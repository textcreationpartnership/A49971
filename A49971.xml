            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not long ſince my happineſs and honour, through the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence of God, to enjoy a Fellowſhip for ſeveral years in that your goodly Seminary of all polite Literature; wherein I hope ſeveral hearts are under Divine hewing and ſquaring for the ſervice of God in his Temple. During my continuance there, I received many favours from you in thoſe Academical preferments which I then enjoyed: Your great love therein I cannot but gratefully acknowledge, and conſtantly bear in minde, having been greatly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and encouraged to the diſcharge of thoſe Employments by your aid and aſſiſtance. Since that time, it hath pleaſed the All-wiſe Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of heaven to place me as a Labourer (though moſt unworthy) in his Vineyard. Moſt ſtately and magnificent is the Fabrick of God's houſe therein ſcituate, yeilding admirable delight to ſuch whom Free-Grace is vouchſafed to give ſpiritual eyes to diſcern it, far ſurpaſſing the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of its ancient Type, <hi>The Temple of</hi> Solomon; which was once the wonder of the world. Some ſpare hours from my conſtantly returning ſervices I have through mercy enjoyed, wherein to take ſome ſolitary turns among the beds of Spices, and there to refreſh my thoughts with the view of the correſponding Parallels. After ſeveral retirements, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken ſome ſmall ſurvey thereof; I conceived it my duty (which I owe to your Foundation) to preſent the firſt Eſſay of this my impoliſhed draught thereof to your view, earneſtly craving of you to undertake the Patronage of your Incumbent in this work. I confeſs I ſhould have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted you in the language of the Gowned Nation; but I ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I had no deſign (when the whole work was finiſhed except the ninth chapter) to have appeared publikely in it, having reſigned it up as a piece of ſervice to a friend, for the company of a larger Treatiſe of his written in our Mother-Tongue upon a ſubject of this like nature; and thereby I ſhould have paſſed through the world with more contenting ſecreſie. But ſince ſome urgent providences (well known to ſeveral of my friends) have over-ruled me to walk without another's ſhelter, I thought it no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe courſe to pitch upon your Candid and Learned Protection. Obliged Duty challenges the tender of my reſpects, and former experience lays the foundation of your expected Favour. The natural love and affection which I ever found planted within me toward that place of my Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (even as I have generally obſerved I know not what <hi>Genius</hi> [may I ſo term it] or affectionate tincture to run in the veins of ſuch as have been bred at <hi>Wadham</hi>) ſtrongly invites me to the former, and I cannot diſpute the equitable return of your kindneſs in the latter; being grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſt experiment. I ſhall mean-while not ceaſe to breathe out hearty
<pb facs="tcp:110568:5"/>
Prayers towards the Golden Mercy-Seat, That all within your Walls may be ſet up for ſtanding Pillars in the Houſe of God, that your hearts may be flaming Altars, your Tongues golden Harps, and that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of praiſe may be your Covering. That the great High Prieſt would pleaſe to ſprinkle your Conſciences from all dead works with his own moſt precious blood, and that he would carry your Names engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the Stones of his Breſt-plate continually before the Father. That Holineſs, Vertue, all ſavoury and wholſome Knowledg, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Praiſe-worthy, may flouriſh and be ever verdant within your Walls. That golden Crowns of Learning, imbelliſh'd with ſparkling Diamonds of Grace may adorn your Heads and Hearts, and give forth a moſt Orient and Radiant luſtre in the Schools of the Prophets. That not only the Lamp of Knowledge ſhining out of the Sanctuary may il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate your mindes with Scripture diſcoveries; But that alſo the Soul ſatiating Bread of life from the golden Table (as of old it was the Prieſts every Sabbath) may be your portion. That ye might all taſte of the hidden Manna, that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod might fragrantly bloſſome among you, and that God would write his Laws, according to the tenour of the New Covenant, not in Tables of ſtone, but the fleſhly Tables of your hearts. That your hope may be fixed within the Vail, ſure and ſtedfaſt; whither the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> is entred for all the Saints. It would be one of the choice joys of the Lovers of that place, to hear concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, that Mercy and Truth have met together, that Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſs'd each other: That all profaneneſs and unholineſs being utterly rooted up and caſt out to the Dunghil, there may ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thence, as may prove Truth's able Champions againſt the <hi>Goliahs</hi> of Errour; and perſons of cementing and healing Tempers, to ſoder and ſalve the Schiſms and Rents in the Church: that Trees of Righteouſneſs may be tranſplanted out of your pleaſant and fruitful Nurſery into the Garden of God, which may yeild all manner of fruit in due ſeaſon. That ſilver ſtreams of conſolation may flow from your Spring (being ſeaſoned with the ſalt of Grace) to refreſh wearied ſouls, and abundantly to water the dry and thirſty places of <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s land. That God's <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> may be with you, enabling ſuch of you as are conſecrated to God, to teach <hi>Jacob</hi> his Judgements, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Law: That you may burn the ſpiritual Incenſe of ſweet ſmelling Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before him, and offer up the whole burnt Sacrifices of the Divine Ordinances upon the glorious Altar within his Goſpel Temple.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here preſent thee with the ſometime moſt pompous and ſplendid Glory of the whole world, <hi>The Temple of Solomon</hi> at Jeruſalem: For proſpect, the moſt pleaſant; for foundation and walls, the ſtrongeſt; for all its circumambient buildings, the moſt Magnificent; for costly Ornaments, the richeſt; and for its myſterious Rites, the moſt Sacred Structure that ever the Sun ſaw. It is commonly reported (as I remember) of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That if he could have obtained the pitch of his wiſhes, he would gladly have ſeen Chriſt upon Earth, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and <hi>Rome</hi> in her Glory. I wonder he mentioned not a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Temple in all its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day bravery, I mean, at the ſolemn Dedication thereof by King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> In the Land-skip of this Treatiſe thou maiſt have a ſhort, and I hope in ſome meaſure, a true glance of its Royalty. Though formerly, as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, thou mighteſt not preſume to enter theſe Sacred walls: yet now, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall being down, thou mayeſt draw near to the Holy of Holyes, without fear of <hi>Craſſus</hi> his doom, never to thrive after his irreverent and bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion. But before I lead thee (Good Reader) into the Temple it ſelf, give me leave to detein thee, while I diſcourſe of ſome few things in haſte, which are neceſſarily to be premiſed to the following Work. Some matters, I confeſs, might have been handled more conciſely, and ſome conſequences might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have been wrapt up in a narrower compaſs. But conſidering that Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the daughter of Brevity, and that the unproficiency of ſome Readers proceeds from the over-frequent uſe of terms of Art, and too compendious expreſsions: I have taken the counſel of <hi>Aelian,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his <hi>Tacticks,</hi> not to involve the ſenſe in obſcure and intricate words; who blames moſt of the preceding Writers, in his kind, thus, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.] <hi>That they wrote, as if all men knew already the things about which they compiled their Treatiſes:</hi> manifeſting by their dark terms (wherein they laboured to be intricate) that they intended not inſtruction, but oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. To let that paſs, The ſame Author promiſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Types or Figures to Illustrate the matter, that the Eye might aſsiſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: So in this Treatiſe thou wilt find ſome figures of the Temple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſerted, which though not fully to my mind, yet may moderately ſerve for the advancement of the true and genuine apprehenſion of its deſcription, as well as to delight the pious fancy of the devout Reader.</p>
            <p>The next thing I am to mention, is that form and figure of the Temple which is exhibited in the fifth part of the Apparatus preceding that late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Work of the many Languaged Bibles. I ſhould not for modesties ſake, and the great reſpect I beare to ſuch noble Labours, whereby not onely our Country, but the very age is honoured, have mentioned any thing of this nature: Had it not openly exhibited the frame thereof different from what is here produced, whereby the very Body of this VVork at the firſt bluſh, would have lain under diſlike in the Cenſure of every vulgar eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:110568:6"/>However, I am not a little ſatisfied, that the Learned and worthy Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of that ſplendid VVork, have not declared it as their own determinate Judgement, but nakedly propoſed it as the conjecture of <hi>Villalpandus</hi> and <hi>Capellus;</hi> and have themſelves onely ordered ſome Plate-views to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for the beautifying of their preliminary Tract, leaving the aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the identity of that viſionary Structure with <hi>Solomon's</hi> unto others. I hope to make it evident in as brief a manner as poſsible, befitting a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face) that there was never ſuch a Temple extant, as is deſcribed by <hi>Villalpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> (the moſt learned and laborious Temple student, that ever proceeded into publick light) which he hath deduced from the profound and myſterious viſions of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to ſpeak at preſent to any other particulars, The wall of the outward Court deſcribed by that Prophet, will yield an invincible demonstration to this aſsertion.<note place="margin">Ezek. 42:16, 17, 18, 19, 20, &amp; 45.2.</note> For in his <hi>42.</hi> and <hi>45.</hi> Chapters, he doth plainly declare, that every ſide of the ſquare walls of the outward Court, did contain <hi>500.</hi> Reeds in length, which will produce in full ſum <hi>2000.</hi> and that compared with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, is co-extended with very near <hi>31.</hi> of that meaſure, as may appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by the <hi>49.</hi> page of this Treatiſe, beneath. But that the Temple ſhould be near <hi>31.</hi> furlongs in compaſs, is very incongruous, and not imaginable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole mount <hi>Moriah</hi> (whereon the Temple was built) fell vaſtly ſhort of this compaſs in the whole circuit thereof: there being ſpare ground left upon the mountain, beſides what was immured within ſacred walls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general conſent of Temple-Writers. Nay, that which ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the incongruity, the Compaſs of the whole City it ſelfe, was but <hi>33.</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, as in the forecited place of this following Treatiſe, is undeniably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a perſon no doubt ſufficiently acquainted with Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. So that conſequently, if the Temple wall ſhould be <hi>31</hi> furlongs in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, according to expreſs meaſures mentioned in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſions, then there will remain but two furlongs for all the ſtately Palaces and private buildings in the City, a thing apparent to every eye, how much it declines from the path of truth. Nay the very Map of <hi>Jeruſalema</hi> given in by <hi>Villalpandus</hi> himſelf, ſufficiently convincing in this matter. Wherefore <hi>Capellus</hi> being much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with theſe meaſures laid down in the Prophet, is over-liberal in his cenſure upon the ſacred Text it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Pag. 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. ad Calcem.</note> and expreſly affirms a corruption of the place. <hi>[Vitium omnino videtur, &amp; pro <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore being himſelfe ſomewhat jealous it ſeems, how ſuch dealings would be reſented by ſober ſpirits, at laſt he flyes to a ſpiritual meaning of the place, that ſince the Temple limits in the Prophetical deſcription do ſo wonderfully ſurpaſs the Circuit of the very Mountain it ſelfe, ſurely it was to Typifie the Church of Chriſt, being the Goſpel-Temple, whoſe great enlargement was ſignified by that viſion: which interpretation ſeems to be very ſolid, and may be farther evidenced by the portions ſet out by the ſame Prophet for the City of Jeruſalem, for the
<pb facs="tcp:110568:6"/>
Priests, for the Prince and the whole Land in ſucceeding Chapters, which do all exceedingly tranſcend the true Geographical limits of the City,<note place="margin">

For who can convincingly and demonſtratively aſſert, that the Prophet doth there deſcribe the ſtate of that first Temple in its priſtine glory, becauſe ſome things therein mentioned do correſpond to what is laid down in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi> Or elſe, that it was the pattern of the ſecond Temple, becauſe the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof in many particulars framing their ſtructures according to the preſident of <hi>Solomons,</hi> (which ſome of the Ancients had ſeen) poſsibly might fall in with ſome points of <hi>Ezekiels:</hi> Seeing it appears obviouſly, that it did diſagree in the main dimenſions, if we compare the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of the covered building mentioned in the Commiſsion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

The Jews themſelves were not ſo rigid, but indulged the ſtudy of the most difficult Scriptures to ſuch as were paſt <hi>30</hi> years of age. The truth is, there are multitudes of Scriptures in the New Teſtament, which cannot be clearly unfolded but by the expoſition of the legall Ceremonies: For when once the the leaves of Types are lifted up, we may diſcern rich cluſters of Grapes hanging underneath to admiration mixt with joy.</p>
            <p>But as to my particular dealing in this matter, I would crave leave to give in a true report of my entring upon and compleating of this preſent work, which in brief is this:</p>
            <p>A loving friend having had ſome intentions to publiſh a Work, holding ſome conſanguinity with this, intreated me as my leiſure permitted, to draw up ſome lines concerning the Temple at Jeruſalem, which might be annexed to his as a ſupplement, which having at length finiſhed according to all the Chapters here preſented ſave one, I freely reſigned my pains unto him for his uſe, to attend his own work, according to his former intention, having obtained a ſtrict promiſe for the concealment of my name therein. But he perceiving what great labour his own would coſt him, and to what a volum it might ariſe, began to be diſcouraged in his deſign. Hereupon I, who never before intended to have gone alone in this, or to have been known, was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at length to compoſe a ninth Chapter concerning the myſteries of the Temple, to adde it to the rest, and commit the whole to the wiſe and holy hand of God, and to the word of his bleſsing. So that indeed over-ruling providence hath brought that to light which was never deſigned in any conſiderable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude, but onely in a few ſheets, in a private way to ſubſerve the deſign of a friend, and testifie my reſpects to him.</p>
            <p>I confeſs the ſubject, though very deep, yet was ſweet in the meditation upon it, and ſomewhat ſutable to my intended inquiries, as the Lord ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me the enlargement of life, &amp; give me gracious opportunities to perform it; &amp; that which was one comfort more, it lay ſomewhat out of the Road of the
<pb facs="tcp:110568:7"/>
bitter skirmiſhings of theſe Times. If any thing herein be ſpoken of as to any preſent point on the ſtage of this day; it is not copiouſly handled,<note place="margin">Praefat. ad Groſted. de Ceſs. Legali.</note> but ſo far forth as my ſolitary path led me to croſs over the main Road ſo full of Duſt and Justling.</p>
            <p>But alas! being in the very midst of my labour and travel through the ninth chapter, I met with enemies upon the Road, perſons of ſordid and moſt illiberal Tempers, whoſe mouths are fill'd with the dirt of lies and ſlanders, whoſe Tongues the Royal Prophet compares to ſharp ſwords, and empoyſoned arrows, who have been the inſtruments of ſome late perſonal troubles (well known to many.) The Lord rebuke them, and forgive them: Or elſe I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged more amply, and reviewed it more diligently then my time would then poſſibly permit. In reſpect to which ninth part eſpecially, as unto the whole likewiſe, I humbly crave the pardoning love and kindneſs of all learned pious, and curteouſly diſpoſed Spirits. Many Scioliſts there be, who looking through the tube of cenſure, will cry out of ſpots in the very Sun; when alas, 'tis but a fly upon the glaſs of envie, through which they pore: yet how many ſpots may be really diſcerned in this poor Tract by able perſons, I am very ſenſible: from ſuch I crave Indulgence.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but it will meet with ſome irreligious <hi>Lucians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Art. Poet.</note> that will ſcorn the very matter and ſubject of the Treatiſe, as times do go: Others like <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> that gave all the Poets the <hi>ferula,</hi> may poſſibly carp at the contexture and compoſition of the work. Let the firſt remember, that though no inherent, yet there was of old a typical and relative holineſs within theſe ſacred walls: The Temple ſhaddows being caſt from the Sun of Righteouſneſs. Such I ſhall leave to the Temple diſcipline of an awakened Conſcience, which in ſome good time may ſcourge them with the ſmall cords of accuſing thoughts, or elſe cauſe them to approach more reverently. As for the latter, let them but expoſe their conceited flouriſhing wits to publike view, and I may promiſe them this deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved favour and equitable requital: That ſome may as Liberally, as Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, and with as <hi>Stoical</hi> a frown condemn their rare and polite Writings, as they have dealt by others. In the mean time, let me deſire them to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate on that true ſaying of our profound Countryman <hi>[Hi prae caeteris ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aliena liberius carpere, qui nihil proprium ediderunt,]</hi>

Such as ſayl upon the vaſt Ocean of Learning, perceive their own knowledg to be equally boundleſs with the natures of things; which have no ſhoars (now in our lapſed eſtate) to terminate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual viſion, and therefore uſually of all others are the moſt modeſt and ſparing in their cenſures: when as mean ſpirits that ſit in little Cock-boats upon narrow Rivers, can eaſily ſpy Banks on both ſides; on the right hand of ſpiritual myſteries, and on the left of humane Learning, being generally moſt confident of their own attainments; and like ſhallow Brooks, make the greateſt pratling.

in their Morals, can trample upon aſperſions as low things, and count it a matter below a Heathen to return them.</p>
            <p>But hoping that the excellency of the Sacred Myſteries lodged within theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces will attract all ſober perſons, poſſeſſed with a ſerious frame of ſpirit, to take delight in waiting at the poſts of Wiſdom, and beholding the beauty of the King of Saints, when held in his galleries, while the Spikenard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 7.2.</note> For ſuch I deſire to pray most ardently, That as the glory of the Lord did in ancient times fill the Temple at its Dedication; ſo the ſame Divine preſence may conſtantly reſide in the Temples of their hearts, and give them radiant conceptions of theſe Divine Myſteries in the enjoyment of Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, where his Majeſty holds ſweet Communion with his people.

One thing more I would ſpeak to, and that is the proportion of gold to ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which according to <hi>Plato, Julius Pollux, Bodinus, Bornitius, Villalpandus, Brerewood,</hi> and generally all learned Authors is accounted to be duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupla, or twelve times as much in value as the like quantity of ſilver: Which although it hath now and then a little vatied, according to the Standards of Princes, or the ſcarcity of metals; yet a twelfth-fold proportion is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received Opinion and Cuſtome of moſt Nations; according to which, we ſhall rate our gold in theſe preparation-Offerings for the Temple.</p>

Each dram being the hundreth part of the maneh, or Hebr. pound: which is uſually ſo among moſt Nations, and may be cleared to be ſo among the Hebrews (I ſuppoſe) from theſe two places compared. The firſt whereof ſays, that <hi>Solomon</hi> made three hundred ſhields of beaten gold, and that three pound of gold went to one ſhield.<note place="margin">1 King. 10.17. 2 Chron. 9.16.</note> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> three manehs. The other place ſayes, he made three hundred ſhields, and that three hundred (<hi>Shekels,</hi> we ſay) went to one ſhield. In the Hebr. it's onely ſaid, that three hundred of gold went to one ſhield: Whereby we learn, that one maneh, and an hundred of ſome one ſort of the Hebr. Weights were equal, which could not be ſhekels: For in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> it's expreſly recited,<note place="margin">Ezek. 45, 12.</note> there went but ſixty ſhekels to a maneh: Therefore it remains moſt probable they were theſe drams, one hundred whereof were in one Hebr. pound, equiponderant to ſixty ſhekels, which in ſilver is 7 <hi>li.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> of ours. The hundreth part whereof is 1 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d. q.</hi> &amp; ⅗ of our money. Now according to the twelvefold proportion of ſilver to gold, a dram of gold is 17 s. 5 d. <hi>ob. q.</hi> ⅕. I know the learned <hi>Brerewood</hi> doth count it by a round number of 15 s. being near in value to the <hi>Adarconims</hi> in the text. But it is to be conſidered, that <hi>Ezra,</hi> or who elſe, that wrought the Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> while in the Captivity, uſing the <hi>Aurei Darici,</hi> or theſe <hi>Adarconims</hi> of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, might make uſe of them, to expreſs the Hebrew drams of gold, as being the neareſt piece in value. Though it's evident enough, that it's neither an Hebrew word originally, nor a coin uſed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who lived ſome hundreds of years before <hi>Darius,</hi> whoſe ſtamp and rate it bare. Now that one Adarconim fell in ſo jump with the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of the Hebr. pound, is but a naked conjecture.

                  </note> or fifty Hebr. manehs or pounds, or one hundred and twenty five pound of our <hi>Troy</hi> weight, reckoning three thouſand ſhekels to the Talent; and each ſhekel to avoid prolixity and trouble at 2 s. 6 d. or our half <hi>Troy</hi> ounce, it would have proved a weight for a Crown not imaginable, and would have almoſt cruſht the Conqueror under this triumphant Ornament into his grave. Yet herein the learned <hi>Scotchman,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Weemſe,</hi> in his <hi>Obſervations</hi> Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>p.</hi> 141. offers his Solution, by a Conjecture that the Crown was firſt broken, and purged by fire, and then made up into a convenient form into a leſs quantity, and fitted for the victorious Temples of <hi>David.</hi> But I rather adhere to the conceit of Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. who expounds it of the value of a Talent of gold, and not of the weight, by reaſon of the precious ſtones that were in it. But however this be anſwered, (with ſome fair and probable interpretations of <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> and others, to ſecure this place, which I cannot now fully inſiſt upon) ſeeing it's generally agreed upon, that the Talent was of this quantity and value fore-ſtated, we ſhall not be Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards in theſe ſacred Expences; but draw up all the ſums in Battalia toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſee what a Volley of Shot they will pay towards the diſcharge of Temple-Expences, wherein we ſhall account each ſhekel of ſilver at 2 s. 5 d. each Talent at 362 l. 10 s. and for gold, each dram at 17 s. 5 d. <hi>ob. q.</hi> ⅕. and each ſhekel of gold at 2 l. 9 s. and each Talent at 4350 li. of our current money.</p>

               <p>Hereby you may perceive that K. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and his Princes together, gave 108000 Talents, 600 ſhekels, and 10000 drams of Gold, and 1017000 Talents, and fifty ſhekels of ſilver to this Work: which in our money amounts to eight hundred &amp; thirty eight millions, four hundred ſeventy ſeven thouſand, three hundred and ſixty two pounds, thirteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſix pence, all depoſited in the hands of <hi>Shelomith,</hi> a famous Lord Treaſurer, the 6th in a direct Line from <hi>Moſes,</hi> being the Son of <hi>Zichri, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Jeſhajah, Rehabiah, Eliezer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Nay, ſo magnifique a ſum it was, that Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> ſometime Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> in his <hi>Encoenia,</hi> or <hi>Dedication Sermon</hi> for <hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> Chappel, conjectures, that if all the Chriſtian Kings that are,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 26.25. Exod. 18.4.</note> would ſend in all they have at once to any one ſervice, it would not equal this Royal-Sum of <hi>David</hi> and his Princes.</p>
               <p>A noble ſum indeed! yet <hi>David</hi> modeſtly and humbly acknowledges all that he gave,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22.14.</note> to be but of his poverty; which we muſt underſtand, as refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon his many troubles and warres, much waſting his Treaſury. But he adds a very divine paſſage,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.14.</note> ſaying, <hi>It was all of Gods own,</hi> and rejoyces that he and his people had hearts to offer ſo willingly.</p>
               <p>After all this, <hi>David</hi> being forbidden to build, yet went as far as he durſt, having ſet Maſons to work in hewing of ſtones, and provided cunning Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22.2.</note> and men skilful in Works, both of Metal and Embroidery: the like whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> deſires the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> to ſend him. All which being done,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> falls aſleep in the Arms of the great Shepheard of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and leaves the management and perfecting of all to his Son.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, we come to <hi>Solomon</hi> furniſhed with ſo vaſt a purſe, the nerve of Peace as well as War, to empty upon ſo glorious a Work, as the building of an Habitation for the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, let us ſee what ſtately preparations he made. Stately, indeed, if ſome ſay true,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 5.1.</note> that he uſed not one mite of his Fathers Treaſures that were thus dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God. Becauſe it is written, ſay they, That he brought all (which his Father had dedicated) into Gods Treaſury, as a Reſerve for extraordinary Emergencies and Reparations. But if theſe Suggeſters had remembred the fore-going Story, which tells us, that ſuch gold, and ſuch ſilver of <hi>David</hi>'s gifts were laid out by weight upon ſuch and ſuch Ornaments and Utenſils,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 28.</note> they would never have troubled their Readers with ſuch a needleſs help to the advancement of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s magnificence; appearing ſplendid enough, and according to the rate of his vaſt and Royal Revenues: which (if <hi>Villalpandus</hi> hit right, in his comparing and caſting it up,) far exceeded the Annual Incomes of the richeſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. But as to this King in the firſt place, for Gold, we find him ſupplyed by <hi>Hiram</hi> with ſixſcore Talents of that metal,<note place="margin">1 King. 9.11, 14.</note> amounting, according to former proportions, to 522000 <hi>li.</hi> of our money: which ſome may conceive to have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Temple, though it doth not clearly ſo appear, but that it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110568:11"/>
was a help to him in the building of all his ſtately Structures,<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> both Sacred and Civil. To which purpoſe, he had beſides laid a great Tax upon his own people.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we read of his providing ſtones of ſeveral ſorts and ſizes,<note place="margin">1 King. 5.17.</note> under the name of great ſtones, coſtly ſtones, and hewed ſtones: which you may lay together, if you pleaſe, as great coſtly hewn ſtones, for the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>As to Timber, we read of three ſorts onely,<note place="margin">1 King. 5.8, 10.</note> Cedars and Firre in one place, and of Almug-trees in another: ſome whereof were brought in ſhips from <hi>Ophir,</hi> to make Pillars in the Temple, as we tranſlate it: But concerning the uſe thereof we ſhall find a more full diſcuſſion in the 2d Chapter, where we ſpeak of the Weſtgate <hi>Shallecheth</hi> in the Outward Court, and of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s ſtately aſcent to the houſe of the Lord; which was beautified and ſtrengthened with Pillars or Rails of Almug-trees. Some whereof he uſed for the Harps and Pſalteries of the Singers. The like of theſe Trees from <hi>Ophir</hi> were never ſeen before, nor ſince in the City <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Some quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of theſe kind of Trees, he received out of the Foreſt of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Other things he provided, as Purple, and Crimſon, and Blue, and fine Linnen, together with cunning Artificers to weave them for the Vailes of the Temple and Veſtments of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>All theſe materials being thus prepared to his hands, this mighty King undergoes the charge of all the Workmanſhip, and gathers a magnificent Army of skilful and induſtrious perſons to manage the buſineſs:<note place="margin">183601. 1 King. 5.15. 80000. 70000. 3300. v. 16. 2 Chron, 2.2, 17, 18. 3600.</note> which aroſe to a ſum of an hundred eighty three thouſand, and ſix hundred men and one. Fourſcore thouſand whereof were hewers in the Mountains: Threeſcore and ten thouſand were bearers of burdens: and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred Officers, as 'tis related in the Books of <hi>Kings:</hi> but there were three thouſand, ſix hundred, as we read in <hi>Chronicles.</hi> To ſolve it, Poſſibly three hundred at a ſecond Review might be added to the number of Officers, for the greater care of the buſineſs.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 8.10.</note> There being fifty Head-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and at firſt but two hundred and fifty Officers next inferiour to them among three thouſand three hundred; and after review, there were three hundred added more: ſo that then there were fifty ſupream-Officers,<note place="margin">1 King. 9.23.</note> five hundred and fifty of the next rate and employment, and three thouſand under-Officers, which makes the full ſum of three thouſand ſix hundred. All which, with their Workmen, were but ſtrangers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not Natives:<note place="margin">1 King. 9.21. 2 Chron. 2.17.</note> or rather ſtrangers in bloud, though neighbors in habitation, being remnants of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> not yet deſtroyed, their number being in full 153600. Beſides theſe, he employed thirty thouſand men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to work in <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> by courſes, ten thouſand in every moneth,<note place="margin">1 King. 5.13.</note> and each third number reſted two moneths at home; over whom, the King placed <hi>Adoniram</hi> as chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: which being joyned to the former number of ſtrangers, makes up the whole ſum at firſt mentioned even 183601.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we read of a vaſt number of men ſent to him from his Father-in-Law <hi>Vafres,</hi> the King of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> ſo ſayes <hi>Eupolemus</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who recites alſo a like vaſt number of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> Scripture mentions nothing of the former: But as to the latter, that King <hi>Hiram,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 5.6: 2 Chron. 2.8</note> upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, did aſſiſt him with the help of his Subjects, is clear, though not to the number: Which ſurely was conſiderable, if we poll the men by their bellies, and if all the ſpecified quantity of Proviſion was diſpenſed onely to theſe Workmen; which ſeems to be ſo in one place, which ſayes,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 2, 10.</note> That theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were allowed for the Hewers, <hi>viz.</hi> Twenty Thouſand Meaſures of Wheat, and as much of Barley; Twenty Thouſand Baths of Wine, and as much of Oyl: Although another place tells us, it was allowed as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual

                  <hi>Corim,</hi> now a Core is equal to a Homer: and uſually as a Homer contains ten Ephahs in dry,<note place="margin">Ezek. 45.11. &amp; ver. 14.</note> ſo doth a Core, becauſe of equal capacity. The quantity of the <hi>Bath</hi> we have endeavoured in the fith Chapter of this Treatiſe to find out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of an Omer to ſeven Attick Coryla's laid down by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> whom we ſhall endeavour (God lending life and opportunity) to examine in another Tract, as to Meaſures: onely at preſent, this ſuppoſition being granted for true and exact, then doth the Bath, and the Ephah its Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Veſſel, contain 52 pounds or pints, and ½ or ſix Gallons, one Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ½ pint. Now becauſe of the hard Work in the Mountains, we will allow theſe proportions to the men in Wine. There being ſpent 616 Tun, and 16 Gallons of Wine upon them, and as much of Oyl, and double as much of Wheat and Barley in a year; we cannot, in conſcience, allow leſs then a pint of Wine in a day for a poor Labouring-man to encourage him: which being of the Red-wine of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> mixt with water, would be a good refreſhment.

We find moreover by this laſt method, that the Angle of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Poſition lyes from the South part of the Meridian 46 gr. 2 min. 52″. So that it lies from <hi>London</hi> South-Eaſt, and 1 gr. 2′. 52″. more towards the fifth point of the Compaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> of SE and by E, which is the moſt exact place of its Situation, reſpecting the Metropolis of <hi>England.</hi> It bears then we ſee from <hi>London</hi> towards a point in the Compaſs, which lies betwixt the South-Eaſt, and the Eaſt South-Eaſt in a direct Line of Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being the Segment of ſuch a Circle, which is equivalent to any of the greater Circles of the Sphere. According to which, ſome devout Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects (perhaps reſpecting the Mother-Church of all Nations at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) have built many of our Churches not full Eaſt and Weſt, but looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Point between the full Eaſt, and the South-Eaſt. But as to the moſt preciſe determination of its diſtance and poſition, if ſome curious Artiſt, reſiding among our Conſuls in the <hi>Levantine</hi> Countries had formerly, or ſhould hereafter exquiſitely obſerve a Lunar Eclipſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which might be viſible, and alſo obſerved at <hi>London</hi> the very ſame time, we might obtain a more punctual deciſion of this Inquiſition, upon which we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. But leaſt the ſituation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as to the Altitude of the Pole there, and its diſtance from the firſt Meridian ſhould not prove (by ſome Eclipſes perhaps to be obſerved hereafter at the ſame time in both places by the mutual conſent of ſome able <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> reſident in each) to have been exactly ſtated by fore-cited Authors: We ſhall adde its bearing and diſtance from ſome famous Towns in the ſame Countrey, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, not being fully ſatisfied about the direct Poſition of <hi>Joppa</hi> (the Port-Town of <hi>Judea</hi>) before-cited, out of <hi>Quareſmius,</hi> to be 40 miles from <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> I obſerved out of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (who being a neer Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> might poſſibly himſelf have made Obſervations in <hi>Syria</hi>) that the Longitude of <hi>Joppa,</hi> from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> is reckoned at 65 gr. 40 min. and its Latitude from the Aequator at 32 gr. 6 min. According to theſe <hi>Data,</hi> having calculated by the former method, I found it to be neer about 27 minutes diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a direct line: which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into miles (by Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi>'s allowance of 66 to a degree) brings forth their diſtance to be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles 29 42/60. or 7/10, or which is all one 3696 feet, that is, almoſt ¾ of a mile. But ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles exceed the <hi>Italian</hi> by 280 feet in each mile, there will ariſe 31 miles, and 1816 feet of <hi>Italian</hi> meaſure for their diſtance: If there were no Hills, nor Windings in the common-high-ways, according to the ſuppoſed ſtating of <hi>Joppa</hi>'s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>

               <p>The place of its ſtructure was in the Mountain of <hi>Moriah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Place.</note> within the Walls of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> very famous for the intended Offering of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and deſigned by God himſelf for this famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the Angel appeared to King <hi>David</hi> (at the ceaſing of that fearful Plague for numbring the People) by the Threſhing-floor of <hi>Arannah</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite.</hi> In which very place, the King built an Altar, and offered ſacrifice to God. In the room whereof, K. <hi>Solomon</hi> afterward erected the great ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Brazen Altar of the Temple. The quantity of ground, which this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpent in its Circuit, is not ſet down in Scripture; neither is it preciſely and Geometrically determined by any of the ancient Writers, or modern Travellers, that I have yet had the happineſs to peruſe. This is certain, that the whole compaſs of the Mountain of the Lords Houſe was much larger,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſephus de bello Judaico,</hi> lib. 1. cap 16. pag. 746. ſayes, it contained as much more, being wall'd in by <hi>Herod.</hi>
                  </note> then that diſtinct piece of Holy Ground, on which the Temple and its Courts were built: eſpecially, ſince we find the famous <hi>Antonian</hi> Tower at the North-Weſt end of the Temple, to have ſtood upon the ſacred Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But as to the quantity and meaſure of the Holy Ground, we ſhall ſpeak in the third Chapter, where we treat of the ſeveral Courts. For our purpoſe is to proceed in the Deſcription, as near as may be, according to the method of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Architects.</p>
               <p>But before we ſet to the main Work, it's doubtleſs expected on all hands, that we ſhould exactly define the length of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cubit, in proportion to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure. This Task might have been taken off long ſince; if the moſt curious and exquiſite Labours of that learned and painful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller Mr. <hi>John Greaves,</hi> ſometimes Aſtronomy-Profeſſor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> had been perfected and printed; which he mentions at the end of his choiſe Tract of the <hi>Roman Foot.</hi> It's hoped, that perſons of Learning and Virtue, will ſcorn to ſuppreſs ſo uſeful a Piece for the Common-Wealth of Learning, if it be in any tolerable meaſure prepared and left in their hands, to whom his Books and Papers were committed. In the mean time (though I intend not to weave a long Diſcourſe at preſent upon this point, yet) I ſhall offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, a ſhort Parallel between thoſe two renowned Authors, <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in their Deſcription of the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Titus,</hi> which may give ſome light in this particular.</p>

               <p>To conclude, I dare not hence peremptorily determine as to this pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual nicety, that the Cubit did neither exceed, nor fall ſhort of this proportioned dimenſion. For who knows not, that Hiſtorians work is not to act the Geometrician: Neither do any ſober men expect ſuch exactneſs from any, but an <hi>Euclid,</hi> an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> a <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> and not from a <hi>Joſephus,</hi> or a <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Therefore, when we read in them the proportions of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, we are to expound them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and according to the vulgar acception. For in this very preſent point, who would not count it a pretty little Wonder, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> cubit ſhould fall in ſo exactly with a <hi>Roman</hi> Foot and half, without the leaſt Fraction? But that it is very neer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I am much inclined to believe upon ſeveral other accounts: Whereupon as a more firm Baſis, I hope to build a larger Diſcourſe concerning this, and other the like points of meaſures, if God grant life and leiſure.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, What a ſmall Houſe will this prove; that is termed in Scripture ſo exceeding magnificent; and in another place very great?<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Chron. 2, 9·</note> if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cubit be of no larger extent. I anſwer, the magnificence is not to be underſtood onely of the covered Holy Houſe, but of all the Courts and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Buildings, and Gates, in and about it, throughout the whole Mountain: which you will find in the next Chapter to be of a very large compaſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the admirable coſt, and mighty ſumptuouſneſs of it, which made it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in glory all the Structures that ever were in the World beſide.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly, you will ſay this Temple-meaſure was different from the ordinary Cubit, by the teſtimony of Scripture it ſelf; which tells us,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 3.3.</note> it was built by Cubits after the firſt meaſure.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: This infers not, that it was built by a greater Cubit, but parallel to the firſt: Whether greater, or leſs, the Scripture doth not determine. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the place ſeems to refer to the Tabernacle-meaſures of <hi>Moſes:</hi> which when any will clearely demonſtrate to be greater, I ſhall be of his mind. In the mean time, all that I have to offer is, that as uſually in the erecting of a new frame, or model of Government, wiſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of old ſtated and cized all manner of meaſures; and as for meaſures of Longitude, uſually took them from the proportions of their own bodies.

And ſo might <hi>Moſes</hi> give the <hi>Hebrews</hi> their Cubit from his own Elbow. Now as a mans foot (if he be a well-proportioned man) is uſually the ſixth part of his own height; ſo the Cubit is the fourth part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Obſervation of <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> If ſo be <hi>Moſes</hi> took off the Cubit from his own Arm, or the fourth part of his own Body:<note place="margin">

It were to be wiſhed, that in ours, and all other Chriſtian Nations, that all Meaſures were, throughout the ſame Countrey, of the ſame proportion and dimenſion, according to the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> (ſo little obſerved among us, though ſo extreamly behoofeful in that point, to the publick intereſt, that the crafty Sellers might not ſo conſtantly impoſe upon harmleſs and ſimple perſons, as to the legerdemain of Meaſures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Traders:) Which commands, <hi>cap.</hi> 25.

Yet to our ſhame, and the general loſs of the Buyers, is not that Law reſtored to its purity.

               <p>But as to preſent Cubit in hand, one thing more I have to offer about the firſt Meaſure, (ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all the wiſdome of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> the principal part whereof was <hi>Geometry,</hi>

That poſſibly <hi>Moſes</hi> and his People, might uſe the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Meaſures: which if true, (though we have no word in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it) then I will recommend to the Readers conſideration, a notable <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cubits out of <hi>Herodotus;</hi> holding it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſpin out any more time on this Subject. The place is in <hi>Euterpe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> or of his Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. In <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>A Pace is ſix Foot, or four Cubits. A Foot is four Palms; A Cubit ſixe Palmes. If you ſay it is <hi>Samian</hi> meaſure, generally uſed by that Author, I anſwer with his own words in the ſame Book, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cubit is equal to that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, what ever the Cubit were, either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Dimenſions of the Temple being deſcribed, not by yards or feet; but under the name of Cubits, the judicious Reader may imagine its length, according to his own moſt exact conception, and ſo conceive the Houſe as large and magnificent as he pleaſe: ſobeit he be careful, that the Battering-Ram of his fancy, do not caſt the Walls, Gates, and Porches, and the poor <hi>Levites</hi> in their Watches, into the Valleys of the <hi>Moriah-Mountain.</hi> For the whole Hill, with the Temple, and <hi>Antonian</hi>-Buildings included, did not contain much more, then about ſix ſtadia in compaſs, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath left upon Record.<note place="margin">

               <p>Since we have then a little cleared off our hands, this tough and knotty rubbiſh of a Cubit, ſo much as to our preſent Deſign: let's begin to lay the Foundations of the Temple, and ſo proceed forward to the Top-ſtone of that admirable Fabrick.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Foundation.</head>

                  <p>BEfore I enter upon the Proportions of this Building,<note place="margin">Situation.</note> its neceſſary we ſhould remember the Temple-Student, what point of Heaven the Porch and its ſtately Entrance did face: For which purpoſe, let's conſider, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his Captivity-Viſion, being brought into the Inner-Court of the Lords Houſe, ſaw 25 men between the Porch and the Altar, with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Ezek. 8.16.</note> worſhipping the Sun toward the Eaſt. Whereby is tacitely implyed, that the Body of his Viſionary-Temple, or the Covered Houſe (the Pattern in many things of <hi>Zorobabels</hi> Structure) was Weſtward of the Brazen-Altar. If this be not enough, obſerve out of another place, that the Gate of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sanctuary [that is the Holy-place of fourty Cubits long,<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.1.</note> as I ſhall ſhew by and by] which looketh toward the Eaſt, was ſhut: Yet once more, when he was brought to the door of the ſame Houſe again, we read, That he ſaw Waters iſſuing from under the Threſhold of the Houſe Eaſtward. For the Fore-front of the Houſe ſtood toward the Eaſt.<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.1.</note> I hope this is a ſufficient Teſtimony, being treble-twiſted, to draw any ſober mans conſent to us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſituation of the ſecond Temple, according to the concurrent judgment both of Jews and Chriſtians, did imitate the former of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. So that now none need fly to any Idiotiſmes, or Proprieties of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language for a Sanctuary, to ſhelter the true ſituation of the Temple, as ſome have done.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful face of the Porch, we will then begin to erect towards the Eaſt-quarter of Heaven,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.3. <hi>Length.

The height of the whole Porch was very ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pompous, <hi>viz.</hi> One hundred and Twenty Cubits. Not that it was all empty and void to the Top, but probably had Chambers and Winding-ſtairs, aſcending up to the Roof. But that the loweſt Concameration of the Porch was more then 22 Cubits, and ½ in height may be evident by the height of the Pillars of Braſs, whereof we ſhall ſpeak anon. Probably, the height of its loweſt Room within, might be equal to the reſt of the Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Thirty Cubits.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Battlements</hi> on the Top of the Porch,<note place="margin">Battlements.</note> we may conceive them to be much of the ſame proportion with thoſe of the Walls of the City fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribed, that is, the height in the open ſpaces, was two Cubits, and the Propugnacles three Cubits, or thereabouts, or rather ſtately Rails of Stone, beſides the more curious Ornaments of Pinacles.

To this about Glaſs Tombes in <hi>Aethiopia, Strabo,</hi> in the 17th <hi>Book</hi> of his <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, p.</hi> 822. of <hi>Caſaubon</hi>'s Edition, and <hi>Diodorus Sic. l.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. and <hi>Cteſias Cnidius</hi> in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> agree with <hi>Herodotus,</hi> though <hi>Cteſias</hi> diſſent from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> about the manner of intombing.

                  <p>THE <hi>Oracle,</hi> ſometimes called the Inner-Houſe, the Inner-Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, and the moſt Holy Houſe, comes next to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed: Where firſt its requiſite we ſhould view the Partition between the Holy place, and this Holy of Holies:<note place="margin">Partition.</note> which mindes me of what I ſhould have mentioned before concerning the Partition, between the Porch and the Holy Place. That there was a Partition, I am induced to believe; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe there is mention made of a ſtately <hi>Door</hi> with <hi>Folding-Leaves,</hi> which needed not to be, if above it, and on both ſides of it, the Porch and Holy place were common. Beſides, what an unhandſome and improper Spectacle would it be, to have a <hi>Door</hi> to ſhut and hinder entrance, if on all ſides elſe it were open. Beſides, I would fain know, what ſupport there was for the Weſt Wall of the Porch, which was ninety Cubits higher then the Houſe, if there were neither Wall nor Pillars beneath; nor Arch-work from the ſide-walls, becauſe of the vaſt magnitude of ſuch an Arch. Moreover, I am the more perſwaded to this thing, by the concurrent Opinion of our Reverend Tranſlators, who tell us,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.33.</note> that the Olive-Tree-Poſts of the <hi>Doors</hi> of the Temple, were a fourth part of the Wall. Well then: Let there be a Wall of ſix Cubits thickneſs erected between the Porch and the Holy place, ariſing to One Hundred and Twenty Cubits in height. The place for the Doors and Poſts containing a fourth part of the Wall, that is according to their conſtruction of the Text: This Partition Wall running North and South Twenty Cubits. The 4th part, <hi>viz.</hi> five Cubits of this, was taken up by the <hi>Doors</hi> and <hi>Poſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There remains but one Conjecture more, and that is, as if the words might favour ſuch a conſtruction, as this, that the <hi>Poſts</hi> whereon the <hi>Doores</hi> were hanged, began to be ſet up on each ſide at the fourth Cubit diſtance from the Wall. There remains then twelve Cubits for the Poſts and Doors:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110568:23"/>
which indeed it's probable, were very large, becauſe folding, and divided into two leaves, But I leave both Conjectures to the conſideration of abler Grammarians, as to the Hebrew Text, and more expert Architects, as to the high Pile of Ninety Cubits of ſtone over the Doors, if they be granted to be ſo large.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the <hi>Partition</hi> between the Oracle, and the Holy-place, it is conceived generally, that it was but one Cubit thick: (but I ſhall ſet down three Cubits, whereof in the concluſion of this Chapter) being atteſted by the Writings of the Rabbins, in their Diſcourſes about the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which had its preſident in many things from this of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. But as to theſe <hi>Partitions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 6.2.</note> one thing may be objected out of that place in the <hi>Kings,</hi> which ſayes, The Houſe (taking both Holy-place and Oracle together) was but ſixty Cubits in length: Whereas theſe <hi>Partitions</hi> being added, will produce ſixty ſeven, for the length of the houſe; beſides the <hi>Porch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this, I anſwer; That Text is to be underſtood of the two inmoſt <hi>Plots,</hi> or <hi>Area</hi>'s laid together in one ſum; <hi>i.e.</hi> Fourty the Houſe, and twenty the Oracle within; whereas there is no account at all of any of the Walls. Now whether this <hi>Partition-Wall</hi> of three Cubits thick, from North to South, were built of any rare precious Stones, or of ordinary Marble (concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the material of the whole Temple) we cannot decide. But that we may confirm this Opinion, that there was a Wall in this place, it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, according to the ſentence of <hi>Junius</hi> &amp; <hi>Tremellius,</hi> who read that Text <hi>[and he made a Partition] fecit interjectum parietem.</hi>

Either that the Poſts were made in form of a Pentagonal-priſme: Or, as ſome uſually, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, term it, five-ſquare. Or elſe we are to underſtand it, That the Door and Poſts took up a ſpace of ground, lying betwixt five Cubits, &amp; meaſured from the North and South-Walls on both ſides; that is, they were extended to &amp; took up ten Cubits ſpace in the Wall: which implyes, the <hi>Doors</hi> to take up as much place as the Wall on each ſide did;<note place="margin">Ezek. 41.11.</note> the whole breadth of the Houſe being twenty.

Now, beſides this inward capacity of the Chambers, we muſt conſider of room for the Beams of the three Floors, and Uppermoſt-Roof at top. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> a moſt laborious and learned Temple-Student, (in his <hi>Comment.</hi> upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 41. of <hi>Ezekiel, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 34.) ſtates the height of theſe Chambers on the Out-ſide of the Temple, to be Cubits 18, and ¾: So that hence there reſts but one Cubit and a quarter for the Windows of the Oracle, which would prove very uncomely, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting the ſtate and magnificence of the Temple to have two or three little Pidgeon-holes at the Top of the Oracle. Beſides, if they be framed, according to <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> they will prove leſs then thoſe of the <hi>Holy-place,</hi> which would be in no ways beautiful, according to Rules of <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nay, he is pleaſed to make part of the <hi>Oracle</hi>-Windows in his Scheme of the Temple, three or four Cubits higher then the <hi>Oracle</hi> it ſelf by his own Scale. But to let this paſs, I know it is obſerved by ſome, that ſeveral places of Scripture, (where God is ſaid to dwell in thick darkneſs) do allude to the Habitation of God's Majeſty, between the Wings of the Cherubims in that dark <hi>Oracle.

                     <p>To conclude; there remains to be conſidered, Whether the out-ſide of the Roof of this Houſe were covered, <hi>ſub Dio,</hi> in the Open-Ayr, at twenty Cubits height, or whether there were any Rooms within thoſe Superiour ten Cubits parallel to the height of the Holy place.

                     <head>Of the Situation.</head>
                     <p>In the firſt place, let's obſerve, that there were no Chambers adjoyning to any part of the Porch: For although the Text tell us,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.5.</note> there were Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers round about, yet it explains it ſelf, when it ſayes, <hi>They were round about the Houſe;</hi> that is, <hi>the Temple and Oracle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 6.6.</note> there being no mention of the Porch at all; which apprehenſion, agrees with the general conſent of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe Chambers, there were three Stories: the nethermoſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was five Cubits broad; the middle, ſix; the higheſt, 7.</p>

                     <head>Of the Breadth.</head>
                     <p>Now, how it came to paſs, that the higheſt Chamber ſhould be the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, the Text, in our Tranſlation, renders an account thus: For without,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in the Wall of the Houſe, he made Narrowed-Reſts round about, that the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110568:25"/>
Beams ſhould not be faſtned in the Wals of the Houſe] The <hi>Expoſition</hi> of this place will clear up the different Meaſures of the Chambers thus: The Wall of the Temple for five Cubits height above the ground, was a Cubit thicker then it was in its height above thoſe five Cubits: So that at five Cubits height, there was a plain parallel to the Horizon of a Cubit broad round about the Temple;<note place="margin">1 King. 6.10.</note> or if you will call it, a Seat of Stone, whereupon one end of the Cedar-Beams of the Chambers did reſt to bear up the <hi>Roof</hi> of the loweſt, or the <hi>Floor</hi> of the ſecond Story. Five Cubits higher from thence, or at 10 Cubits height from the ground, the thickneſs of the Temple. Wall was yet a Cubit leſs; and upon that ſecond Seat thus made by a Cubits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement in the Wall, reſted the Cedars Beams for the <hi>Roof</hi> of the ſecond, and <hi>Floor</hi> of the third Story.</p>
                     <p>At 15 Cubits height from the ground, the thickneſs of the Temple-wall was yet ſtill a Cubit leſs then it was at 10 Cubits height, which yielded a third Seat, on which the Beams for the <hi>Roof</hi> of the third and higheſt Story were laid. So then, hence we learn, that as the Wall of the Temple abated in thickneſs, ſo the Meaſure of the Chambers increaſed in breadth; that the loweſt being five; the ſecond ſix; the third did prove 7 Cubits broad; and yet on the Out-ſide, the ſtone-work of the Chambers was perpendicularly equal: So that they made a ſhew to Spectators, at a diſtance, much like the lower Leads of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches.</p>

                     <head>The height of the Chambers of the Temple.</head>
                     <p>Here alſo remember, that we uſe the numbers of 5, 10, and 15 Cubits for the Rebatings in the Wall at ſuch heights, meerly becauſe Scripture is ſilent of the thickneſs of the <hi>Floors</hi> between Chamber and Chamber: Whereas properly, when the height of each Chamber is ſaid to be five Cubits, we muſt apply this to the inward content of the Chambers: For though <hi>Temple-Writers</hi> generally tell us,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.10.</note> that all the three Stories were 15 Cubits high, yet we read no ſuch thing in Scripture; onely that each was five Cubits high: Which, that it is meant of the inward capacity, is probable from the uſuall Deſcriptions of the other Temple-Buildings; as of the Porch, Holy-place and Oracle, whoſe Dimenſions are onely proportioned to the inward part: as is clear of the Oracle, by the extent of the Cherubims Wings. Beſides, from the quantity of a Cubit before-ſtated (which I hope, by divine permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more fully to demonſtrate hereafter in another place) If it be but a <hi>Roman-Foot</hi> and half, or very near that point, then the Beams, and Boarding, and Carved-Work, will take up ſo much of each Story, as that a very tall and proper man would almoſt touch the Cieling, which would prove very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly in ſuch Buildings. Beſides, if the judgment of <hi>Arias</hi> and <hi>Villalpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> may be taken, they raiſe the Top of the third Story to 18 Cubits, and ¾ allowing a Cubit, and ¼ for each Partition.</p>

Wherefore, as they were in the ſecond, ſo we ſhall be content, at preſent, to ſet them down 12 on the North, 12 on the South, and 6 at the Weſt-end of the Temple; that is, four on a Floor on the North and South, and two at the Weſt.</p>

                     <p>As to the length of each Chamber; this is a certain way, in caſe they were all of one Size, to allot a fourth part of the length of the Temple and Oracle for each Chamber, and its ſeparation from the other, on the North and South ſides: But at the Weſt-end, the juſt half. Onely here we muſt, in this diſtribution, warily conſider, that the thickneſs of the Temple-walls, conjoyned in the North-weſt, and South-weſt Angles, muſt extend the length of the Chambers as far, as the thickneſs of the Wall did increaſe the outward Dimemtions, beyond the inward of ſixty Cubits, commonly ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.

So then, if you take the Meaſures thus: fourty Cubits for the Holy-Houſe; three for the Partition, as I ſhall mention anon, my conjecture in the cloſe of this Chapter; Twenty for the Oracle, ſix for the ſpace parallel to the thickneſs of the Temple-walls;<note place="margin">

It will then be apparent, that the ſpaces for the Chambers, on both ſides, and the end, with the Temple, will fall into a Figure, containing four Parallello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams; as you may ſee in the 35 of the firſt of <hi>Euclide.</hi> The length of theſe ſpaces, is 74 Cubits; which divided into four parts, gives 18 Cubits, and ½ for each Chamber and its Wall: Whereof the firſt Wall begins at the Weſt. But ſeeing the thickneſs neither of the Temple-walls, nor of theſe Chambers is determined in Scriptures, we cannot apply any exact meaſure for the length of each, or of all the Chambers together; and therefore item would be very abſurd to lay any ſtreſs upon ſuch conjectures, which we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fully to every acute Architect. The Doors of the lower of theſe Chambers were on the ground: But for the middle Chambers on the right ſide of the Houſe; that is, the South,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.8.</note> at the top of Winding-ſtairs; and out of the middle, there were Aſcents into the Upper-rooms.

Moreover, it is conceived, that there were no Doors on the Out-ſide at all; and that above there were Galleries to walk round about on all ſides the Temple, to any particular Chamber: as alſo, into the chambers over the moſt Holy place: Nay, and thoſe over the Sanctuary alſo; according to <hi>Arias,</hi> who would have that place within to be no higher than the Oracle, <hi>i.e.</hi> Twenty Cubits, and to

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Courts and Buildings about the Temple.</head>
               <p>THere are various Opinions of the number, quantity, and form of the Courts of the firſt Temple.</p>
               <p>Some hold that <hi>Solomon</hi> built but one Court; and that,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.36.</note> by the two Courts mentioned in Scripture, we are to underſtand (ſay they) firſt, the Prieſts Court, which indeed they grant he built,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.36.</note> and to be called the Inner-Court. But by that called the Outer or greater Court they conceive we are to underſtand it of the Mountain of the Houſe, which lay wide and open.</p>
               <p>Some hold there were two Courts built even by <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, which in concluſion, I believe, will prove the trueſt. Others there be, that hold he built four, though upon very improbable grounds.</p>
               <p>As for the quantity of one or other, I find as yet none peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining: for indeed Scripture in that is fully ſilent.</p>
               <p>For the form or faſhion, many hold that both Courts did compaſs the Temple on all ſides round about; which, with ſubmiſſion, I ſuppoſe, after ſerious ſearch, will prove moſt correſpondent unto truth. Others are of a mind, that the Prieſts Court did not compaſs the Temple, but that the outer did. Others think, that neither of the Courts did compaſs the Temple; but that both of them ſtood on the Eaſtſide of the Temple, one before the other. Now all the Weight of this laſt Opinion lyes on poor <hi>Joſephus</hi> his back; wherein we ſhall with all modeſty endeavour to clear, that his words ſeem to be miſapplyed to their purpoſe: and afterwards (I hope) in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, make it appear evident, that there were two Courts, or walled Area's in the time of the firſt Temple, built by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and atteſted by <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf to be round about the Temple.</p>
               <p>But firſt let us lay this Rub gently out of the way, by enervating that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of two Courts one before another, grounded upon miſconſtruction of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> The place cited for this fancy of theirs,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> &amp;c. Which place, becauſe I would neither burden the Preſs, or the Reader, with the <hi>Greek</hi> at length, I ſhall give it in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus. <hi>[But the Temple was built, as I have ſaid, upon a hard Mountain. At firſt, the uppermost Plain was ſcarce ſufficient for the Temple, and the Courts of the Altar</hi> [The word here in the <hi>Greek is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and is taken for the Court of the Altar in this place; and <hi>pag.</hi> 918. <hi>D.</hi> and expreſly <hi>Joſephus</hi> declares concerning <hi>David,</hi> when God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his Offering (after the Plague) on <hi>Moriah,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He determined to call the whole place, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the Holy Mountain, the Altar of all the people, <hi>pag.</hi> 245. <hi>F.</hi> To proceed then in the recital of his words, as follows] <hi>For the Verge thereof</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>was ſteep and precipicious. But when King</hi> Solomon <hi>(who alſo built the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) had raiſed a firm Wall on the Eaſt ſide, there was a Porch built upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Bank of Earth. But on the other ſides, the Temple lay naked; till in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the people always adding earth the top became even and large.</hi>] Now in this citation, the great ſtreſs of the queſtion lies in the ſenſe of thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Temple was naked or open.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:110568:28"/>For the Explication of which words, I beſeech the candid and judicious Reader; Firſt of all to conſider, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth not ſay, The Plain was <hi>Not ſufficient:</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſcarce ſufficient. Beſides, he doth not ſay, <hi>[The Hill]</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: the ſmooth equall Plain at top without any the leaſt declivity, was ſcarce ſufficient: Whereas in truth, it was the more fit and proper place for to build the Temple upon, becauſe of its praerupt declivities: Which being framed into ſeveral ſquares ſuperior each to other, might yield a moſt pleaſant and delicious Proſpect, not unlike the ſtately Gardens of that ancient Seat of Sir <hi>Edward Stradlings</hi> at St. <hi>Donats</hi> in <hi>Glamorgan-</hi>ſhire, or any other of the like nature among the Palaces of our Nobles in this Nation. For according to this projection of the frame of the Temples Situation, the Courts and other Buildings might lye ſomewhat below it, that ſo by graceful ſteps and aſcents, out of one Court into another, the Temple might appear the more Auguſt, ſtately, and lofty to all Spectators. But I mainly deſire the ingenuous Reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> is not here diſcourſing of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple <hi>ex indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriâ,</hi> but curſorily, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the way onely: Wherefore he is not here ſo much to be attended to, as in thoſe places, where he makes it his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular work and buſineſs to deſcribe the form and meaſure of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. There you ſhall find him reading another Leſſon. If then any ſhall inſiſt upon it, and take his words here ſo ſtrictly and rigorouſly, I fear his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Ghoſts will prove angry, and engage fully againſt them by and by. Yet however, as to this very place, the words immediatly going before ſhew, that he was hinting at thoſe mighty Foundations of four hundred Cubits deep in ſtone (mentioned elſewhere fully) which being raiſed up to their intended height, by a perpendicular Line, aggeſtions of Earth and Rubbiſh were added to the declivity of the Hill, to make the Hill and the Stone-Foundations even. Upon which Foundations, <hi>Solomon</hi> raiſed a ſtately Porch, called ſo in after-ages by his name. Now immediately upon theſe words, comes in the controverted paſſage <hi>[But on the other ſides the Temple was naked]</hi> Of what was it naked? of Courts and Walls? as they would hence infer? No ſure! the laſt thing he ſpake of, was of Porches: of ſuch then we will, grant the Temple was naked, <hi>viz.</hi> As to ſuch rare ſtately double Porches built on ſuch vaſt and famous Foundations, as were upon the Eaſt-ſide, we may yield, that the other parts were ſomewhat leſs ſplendid and famous: Nay poſſibly at the firſt Work of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the other ſides might not be por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by him: but that after he had finiſhed his own and the Queens houſe, it appears ſomewhat probable by Scripture it ſelf, that he porched both Courts round about, as in after lines may more fully appear: and therefore this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> poſſibly may be favourably interpreted of the firſt days of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> that ſo we may ſalve <hi>Joſephus</hi> his credit and reputation: Which will elſe appear to be very infirm and lubricous. We will not then conſtrue him in that ſenſe, as if there were no ordinary Wall compaſſing the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Houſe, or ordinary Porches incloſing a piece of ground, which was termed the Outer-Court. This, according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant: For, concerning walls and Porches round about, we ſhall find our apprehenſion by and by to be ſufficiently averred, that they were extant under the firſt Temple, (with their Gates oppoſite to the four Cardinal Winds) and all this ſhewn by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that they were even built by King <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, where he handles that Kings Fabricks of ſet purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:110568:28"/>Beſides, the words following, as well as thoſe preceding in this preſent Text of our Jewiſh Hiſtorian, do alſo argue, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> meant by this phra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Temples nakedneſs, its being deſtitute of ſuch ſtately Porches on each ſide, at its firſt Erection except on the Eaſt-Quarter: For he tells us afterward, that in enſuing Times, there was a Three-fold Wall about the Temple, and that the Foundations of the loweſt parts of the Outward Wall were three hundred Cubits high; in ſome places more:<note place="margin">1 King. 6.36.</note> and that the ſtones were fourty Cubits large. Upon ſuch Foundations (ſayes he) there were Buildings erected worthy of them; to wit,<note place="margin">1 King. 7.11.</note> double Porches ſuſtained by Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Twenty five Cubits high, that were ſingle ſtones of Marble: And moreover he relates, that thoſe Porches were Thirty Cubits broad, and the whole compaſs of them, together with the Tower <hi>Antonia,</hi> was ſix Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence we may learn, that for ſuch ſtately Fabricks as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Eaſtern Porches, and thoſe afterwards added, there was neceſſity of mighty ſtrong Foundations. Of which vaſt Foundations, with their ſtately Porches built upon them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Temple was deſtitute, and lay open, in compariſon of the Eaſt-ſide, where <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf had yet at firſt onely built them.</p>
               <p>But that there was a Wall including the greateſt part of the Mountain of the Houſe with ſeveral Gates, the ſame Author ſhall preſently ſatisfie you, and that fully. Wherefore, as to ſuch vaſt additions of Earth, as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, I have this conception onely to give in, <hi>viz.</hi> That where the Walls were raiſed ſtraight up out of the Valley, for to build theſe Porches upon, the Earth was pared from rough and uneven places of the Hill, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Labourers from place to place, to fill up thoſe hollow inequalities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the raiſed Walls, and the ſloping declivity of the Hill; for all that was thus labouriouſly performed, was to this end, even to make the Temple ground riſe by degrees ſmoothly from the Eaſt-gate of the Outward Wall up to the Temple it ſelf. For the Mountain it ſelf was but little added ro by all theſe induſtrious Labours, as to its main parts, receiving no acceſſion of <hi>Pelion</hi>'s, or <hi>Oſſa</hi>'s Caſt upon it, or laid to it, as ſome fondly dream Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, you may pleaſe to read that Learned piece, (of the Temple, in our Saviour's days) written by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, pag.</hi> 4 &amp; 5.</p>
               <p>But ſubmitting the whole to ſober and unbyaſſed perſons, I ſhall now proceed to prove that their Work were two Courts compaſſing the Temple, which I ſhall divide into two Sections: Firſt of all, that there were two, and that even by Scripture it ſelf. Secondly, that theſe two encompaſſed the <hi>Covered Temple.</hi> To which purpoſe, we read in the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi>

               <p>Moreover, that there muſt be laid out a very large Court without the Prieſts Court in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days,<note place="margin">1 King. 8.14. 2 Chron. 6.12.</note> may appear from the vaſt multitudes of People which were at the dedication of the Temple, called <hi>[All the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Iſrael]</hi> no doubt all the males of all the Land, according to the command of God: for the Dedication was juſt in the ſame moneth with the Feaſt of Tabernacles.

But without this Wall, he built a Court in a four-ſquare Plót of ground, raiſing great and broad Porches, and opening with High-gates: Each whereof did look upon each of the Winds, being ſhut with Golden Doors. Into this Court all the People might enter, that were distinct from others in their purity, and obſervation of the Laws. But this outward Court appeared unſpeakably admirable: nay, beyond the belief of a mans own eyes. For filling up deep Vallies (ſuch as for their wonderful depth, it was not eaſie to look down to their bottome) and raiſing them four hundred Cubits high, he made the top equal to the heighth of the Mountain, on which the Temple was built: and ſo the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward open Court became equal in height to the Temple-Court.</hi> (that is, its inward Court: For <gap reason="foreign">

For according to the common acception of a Cubit, it anſwers well near to a yard, and ½ of our meaſure, giving admiſſion to the eyes of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cized men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this Story of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> you may obſerve an outward Court, compaſſing the inward, which is cleared by this paſſage, that it had Gates opening to the four Winds of Heaven. Whereas if this outward Court ſtood onely <hi>ab anteriori parte,</hi> juſt before the inward Court toward the Eaſt, then it had not any Gate properly belonging to it opening to the Weſt: for that Gate on the Weſt of the Outward Court fancied to be of this anterior ſituation, was the famous Eaſt-gate of the Prieſts Court, and properly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the inner-Court: Whence it will follow, that the exteriour Court, according to this their conjectured Situation, will have no Weſt-gate at all. But to let this paſs at preſent, the quantity and meaſure of the Weſt-Wall of the outward Court, together with the ſituation of its gates, puts all out of controverſie: For by what hath paſt, and ſhall be cited, you may perceive that each ſide of this outward four-ſquare Court was a Furlong at leaſt in length.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:110568:30"/>Thirdly, It's famouſly known, that the outward Court, (or <hi>exterius Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> as <hi>Gelenius</hi> renders thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) had thoſe rare Cloiſters built by King <hi>Solomon;</hi> which ſeemes in ſome meaſure manifeſt, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf.

Now theſe holy Perſons, being not Prieſts, could not, by the Law, be admitted into the inner Court. Wherefore it reſts upon the proof of that aſſumption, (that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porches built on ſuch rare and ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foundations were on the Eaſt ſide of the outward Court in thoſe ancient daies) I ſay, it followes that there was ſuch an exterior Court extant in thoſe times, thus porched by that magnificent King: whoſe example, for the form, and the expreſſe tract of Walls and Porches, was generally imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Architects of the ſecond Temple, as I have often mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the ſenſe of grave and ſerious Authors, not without good probability of truth.

So that 600 half inches, at 12 inches in a foot, make up thoſe 25 Feet in the Roman Stadium, beyond the number of feet in the Grecian.</p>
               <p>Moreover, from the laſt cited place of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> we may obſerve, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is mentioned to have built Porches, at firſt, on the Eaſt end onely: which ſerves to expound the ſo much vexed, and miſinterpreted Paſſage of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which was in Controverſy, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Temple was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>It was destitute of Porches on any other ſide of the Temple,</hi> at leaſt in the firſt times of <hi>Solomon.</hi> For the Scripture ſeems to favour his porching of the Courts of the Lord's houſe round about, at the twenty years end, when he had finiſhed the houſe of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> his Pallace and Throne, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Queens houſe, according to the order of its Relation 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.12. Though, its certain, Preoccupations are frequent in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Leavs; as immediately about the Utenſils of the Temple, after all; and therefore we ſhal not rigidly preſs upon it from Scripture, though <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his 8th book is peremptory in this point, as you have read above. So that if you will permit <hi>Joſephus</hi> to be his own Interpreter, as 'tis all the reaſon in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110568:31"/>
the World he ſhould, behold him now joyning hands with our expoſition.</p>
               <p>Thus much then may abundantly (I hope ſuffice, as to the two firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, out of Scripture, and out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to prove two Courts round about the Temple, eſpecially out of the laſt, whoſe Authority was alwayes brought to contradict it.</p>
               <p>The third Argument may turn upon the Hinges of the Temple Gates, in the outward Court, opening of their own accord for a deciſion to this controverſy: which were placed to all the four winds, ſaies <hi>Joſephus.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently clearing, that the great Court was round about the covered buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For he tells us expreſly in another place, concerning the inward Court of the ſecond Temple (according to very judicious Perſons, it being correſpondent in moſt things to the firſt) that it had no Gate toward the Weſt. Theſe are his words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If then there were Gates to all the winds,<note place="margin">De Bell. Judaic. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>916.</hi> F.</note> and if there was none on the Weſt in the inner Court, it followes, that the Weſtern Gates of the Temple muſt be placed in the outward Wall of this great Court, compaſſing the Temple and the inner Court round about.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Compaſſe of the wall of the outward Court being four Furlongs, according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> his deſcription of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s buildings, each furlong taking up a whole ſide of the Quadrangle: doth clearly determine the Gates on the Weſt ſide to be in the wall of the outward Court, which by its largeneſſe muſt needs be ſuppoſed to compaſſe the inner.</p>
               <p>I will yet add two probabilities to this purpoſe, that the Court did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the Temple. The firſt may be taken from the dimenſions and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle. Wherein we read that the Court was ſet up round about <hi>[The Tabernacle.]</hi> This might be fully demonſtrated from the length and bredth of the Court and Tabernacle.<note place="margin">Exod. 40.8.</note> The Court is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to have been 100 Cubits long and 50 broad. The covered Tabernacle, <hi>Torniellus</hi> and others do evince,<note place="margin">Exod. 27.18.</note> from the meaſures of the Boards and Curtains, to have been but 30 Cubits long and 10 broad within,<note place="margin">Annal. ad ann. <hi>2544.</hi> Num. <hi>60.</hi>
                  </note> and conſequently to have been placed within the Court. Now, that the Temple did in many things imitate <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle, though general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double to its dimenſions, is clear to every one: being 60 long and 20 broad, as to inward capacity, the Walls not being conſidered; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> was but 30 in length and 10 in bredth, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> aboveſaid. Wherefore then, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his covered Tabernacle ſtood within its Court incloſing it round on every ſide: ſo it is ſomewhat probable that in this particular the Imitation might ſort; even that the covered Temple ſtood within the Walls of its Courts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond probability may be deduced from <hi>Zorobabel</hi>'s and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Temple, agreeing in moſt things with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, as very ſober Authors, upon ſerious deliberation, do hold forth; only the Fabrick of the laſt covered houſe was ſomewhat larger. But <hi>Herod</hi>'s Courts, conceived by many to be praeciſely wrought up in the very <hi>vestigia</hi> or prints of <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s Walls, did compaſs the Temple round about, as may be cleared out of the Jewiſh writers, and particularly out of <hi>Codex Middoth</hi> and <hi>L'Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> the learned Commentator upon it. Which probably being erected, according to the pattern of the ancient Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſeverall judicious Writers, as I have often hinted, may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure help to confirm the aſſertion of its compaſſing Courts, before largely treated of, from the teſtimonies of the ſacred Scriptures, and our often ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hiſtorian of the Jewiſh Nation.<note place="margin">Montania.

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>At length, to conclude, the conſent of many very learned men, both Jews and Chriſtians, in this particular, is very conſiderable. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Montanus</hi> doth ſomewhat vary from others in the frame and form of

the compaſſing Courts, conceiving them to be largeſt at the Eaſt end, and narroweſt at the Weſt.</p>
               <p>But of the Courts encompaſſing the Temple never did any doubt, (that I yet read of) till <hi>Ribera,</hi> upon the miſconſtruction of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> in that forecited paſſage <hi>[<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note>Thus much may then ſuffice, as to the number of Courts in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s daies. Firſt, that for certain there were two in number. Secondly, that moſt probably there were two onely. Thirdly, that for form they were quadrangular, and both compaſſing the Temple. If you will adhere to <hi>Montanus,</hi> then you muſt not conceive each Quadrangle to be aequi-lateral: but the Eaſt Wall to have been far longer then the Weſtern. Yet if you will follow the generall opinion: Then the Courts, wherein the covered Temple ſtood, were each of them of a ſquare aequi-laterall Figure, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the other. Fourthly, it's moſt probable that the new Court, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Court, together with the Chel, or ſeparate place, of 11 Cubits broad, encloſing both the Prieſts and the Womens Court, round about with a Wal, were not extant in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s daies. But, that they were laid out during the firſt Temple, and encloſed with walls, it's imagined by ſome to be manifeſt in a good meaſure from Scripture it ſelf, and the Teſtimony of Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But becauſe their laſt Erections were not digeſted by <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor diſtinctly mentioned in Scripture, we have taken leave to diſmiſſe them to the deſcriptions of the Rabbies, and their Sectators, and the Commentators on the viſionary Temple of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>

To which may be anſwered, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> lays down the ſame meaſure for the External Court of both Temples: Upon which, and other accounts, it is, that ſober and learned perſons have generally conceived the form and quantity of the Outer-Court, to have been the ſame under both; and therefore it will be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enough to our work in hand, to make an inquiry into the ſenſe of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> ſo far as my ſmall acquaintance will give me leave to trade with them, and to obſerve what communion there is droven betwixt them and <hi>Joſephus.</hi> To this end it will not be amiſs to call to mind, that <hi>Villalpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> in many places, doth quote <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as averring, that the Wall of this Outer-Court, was but 400 Cubits ſquare; and, particularly, in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus, Pag.</hi> 118.8.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110568:33"/>
that a Greek Stadium (with which, as the other Meaſures alſo of capacity better known to the Jews, then the Roman quantities, <hi>Joſephus</hi> frequently compares his <hi>Hebrew</hi> Meaſures) was exactly 600 <hi>Grecian</hi> feet; of which before: So ſayes <hi>Cenſorinus; Stadium Olympicum est pedum, DC.</hi> Beſides,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>13.</hi> de die natali.</note>

                     </note> that the whole compaſs of the ſacred ground, together with the <hi>Antonian</hi> Tower, was ſix Furlongs; which muſt be thus underſtood, That the Temple-ground contained four Furlongs in compaſs: for ſo he ſayes diſtinctly, that each ſide was a Furlong; and that the Tower-Plot took up in compaſs two Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, even as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath determined it in his Second Temple, and was four-ſquare at the North-Weſt end of the Temple Porches. Each ſide of the Tower then was half a Furlong; ſo that the North and Weſt-ſides took up but half of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> one Furlong: by which computation, <hi>Joſephus</hi> will agree with the <hi>Rabbins</hi> exactly enough. Though I fear both of them ſpeak but at large, that their Meaſures may fall into round num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But let it be here remembred, that this Tower being at firſt uſed for the Manſion-houſe, and laying up of the Garments of High-Prieſt; which ſtanding upon a ſpare place of the Mountain of the Houſe, is by them caſt into the Reckoning of Holy Ground: Not but that yet there was ſome portion of ground remaining on the Weſt, and on the North, for profane, and not at all counted in any of their ſums. So then taking the Circuits of the Temple, and <hi>Antonia,</hi> diſtinctly and apart, we ſee that the Temple was four Furlongs about, and <hi>Antonia</hi> but two; which being put into one ſum, makes ſix. But if you joyn the Circuit round about both of them, reckoning onely the two Out-ſides of <hi>Antonia,</hi> that are fartheſt from the Temple, there will reſult but five Furlongs for the compaſs of the holy ground, commonly ſo reputed. To which, very clearly and patly, agrees a paſſage of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> out of <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> concerning the Pipes, laid under the Temple, for conveyance of Water, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

So that there will be left by <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Meaſures of the Temple, but a little above two Furlongs for the whole City. Inſomuch, that we may juſtly wonder at the coſts and pains of <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> in his large Volumes, building a Temple without any ſolid Foundation for its Dimenſions, to be extended upon the holy Mountain, which was incomparably leſs in its whole Circuit, then <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple-Courts. Well then, we muſt not be peremptory in this buſineſs: I ſhall onely preſent to conſideration thus much concerning this inward Court of the Prieſts in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days: That ſeeing the Temple it ſelf, or the covered Building was in its inward Dimenſions, double to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle; why may not the Court about it be double to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Court? The holy Place and the <hi>Oracle,</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> was 30 long; with <hi>Solomon,</hi> 60 long. The breadth in the Tabernacle was 10, and in the Temple 20. Then ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> his Court was one hundred Cubits long and fifty broad, why may we not thence allow the Prieſts Court round about <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, to be two hundred long, and one hundred broad? This conjecture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fortified by the plain Ground-Plot, or Area, of this Court under the ſecond Temple: For we read expreſly,<note place="margin">Codex Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth. p. <hi>169.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> that it was one hundred eighty and ſeven long: ſo that our two hundred Cubits yields ſix Cubits, and ½, for the thickneſs of the Walls, Eaſt and Weſt, in that Court, to make its Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons co-incident with the ſecond Temple. But as to the breadth, North and South, let's conſider, that the Temple-Building, with its appendant Chambers, in its inward Area, (not meaſuring the Walls; for in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, they are to be excluded) was triple to the inward Area of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Tabernacle, which was but ten Cubits broad within. Now in the Temple, the Holy Place was twenty Cubits broad, and the Ground-Chambers, on each ſide, were five Cubits a piece in Floor, that's ten for both, making thirty in all for the inward A real capacity of the breadth of the covered Temple, neglecting the Walls: So then, upon this ſuggeſtion, conſequently, the breadth of the Prieſts Court will fall out to be one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Cubits in all, which is in triple proportion to the Court of <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Tabernacle, being but 50.<note place="margin">

                  <p>I anſwer; Firſt, that the Porch was onely for beauty, but the Side-Chambers were for uſe. And, ſecondly, the marvellous co-incidency of this our conjecture, with the Meaſures of the ſecond Temple, doth much allure us,<note place="margin">Middoth. Ibid.</note> to lay down theſe proportions. For therein we read, that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Court was 135 broad in open Area, leaving 7 Cubits, and ½ for the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the two Walls, on the North and South, that it may ly parallel with 150 Cubits of our ſuppoſed breadth of this Inner-Court, in triple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Court of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Courts then in ſome meaſure, (I hope) are fixed, as to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and faſhion, including the Temple within two Squares; though as to their Dimenſions, I can ſay nothing peremptorily: onely that the great Court (if <hi>Joſephus</hi> may be believed,) was four hundred Cubits ſquare, and ſo compleatly finiſhed, as to the Foundations out of the Valleyes, the Wals, the Gates, and the famous Porch at the Eaſt end, and other ordinary Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches round about, even by <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf; as we have before manifeſted from that Author. The Prieſts Court probably, fixed by proportion, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Tabernacle to the Temple, and concurring with the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that Court under the ſecond Temple.</p>

                  <p>There was alſo the ſeparate place, or the Incloſure, called Chel, which ran round about both the Prieſts Court, and the Womens. But their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is utterly undeterminable out of Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">

There are two probabilities to ſtrengthen this conceit. Firſt, that it was called the high-Gate, becauſe ſituate on the higheſt ground of <hi>Moriah:</hi> which was at the Weſt end of the Temple: ſo confeſſed by all. Secondly, the Eaſtern Gate though pompous, yet it's obſerved by <hi>Dr. Lightfoot</hi> that its Battlements were made low,<note place="margin">Temple ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, cap. <hi>17. §. 2.</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, probably, the Weſtern Gate was built the more magnificently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the royall entrance of the Kings.

So that <hi>Joſephus</hi> acquainting us in his ſixth Book, of the Jewiſh Wars, that in <hi>Solomon's</hi> days the Temple was naked and open on all ſides but the Eaſt; till after-ages raiſed the praecipitious declivity, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of Earth: (that ſo he may not appear contradictory to himſelf) we muſt explain him of thoſe vaſt Subſtructions of Stone-Walls, raiſed out of the deep Vallies, and ſtately double Porches built upon them, as at the Eaſt end: Whereas, if he means by <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore in this laſt written Book of his Antiquities, clearly deſcribing of Porches round about, even built by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> he doth tacitely retract his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errour about the nakedneſs of the Temple in his Jewiſh Wars; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but wonder at <hi>Ribera,</hi> and his Proſelytes, in this particular, that they ſhould lay the ſtreſs of their opinion about the deformity of the Temple on theſe two or three words; ſo often mentioned; eſpecially ſeeing he himſelf gives <hi>Joſephus</hi> this deplorable Character <hi>[ſayè ita lubricus eſt, ut cum maxim? tenere eum credas, elabatur] Riber. de Templ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 28. He ſays, a little before, that he was a grave Hiſtorian, and an Eye-witneſs, and yet preſently that he is ſuch a ſlippery fellow, that when you do moſt confide, in having attained the true ſenſe of his mind, He ſlips like an Eele through your fingers: Almoſt as bad as that Stigma impreſt upon another Author, which I have heard of; He was a good Hiſtorian, but that he wanted truth. To let paſs then the modern Opinions of ſome few that ſlip down the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity after <hi>Ribera</hi> for want of Courts and Walls, as having no plain Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their own ſtanding, we ſhall proceed to a further view of this magnificent Temple; having, we hope, clearly recovered its priſtine luſtre in the circum-ambient Buildings, and gained moſt beautiful Porches, with ſtately Pillars round about both the Courts: Onely where there were Gates with their Buildings, and Chambers with their Treaſuries.</p>
                     <p>That there were Treaſuries and Chambers round about in the Courts, is evident by King <hi>David's</hi> Pattern given to <hi>Solomon,</hi> which no doubt he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly followed, or elſe God would not have declared himſelf well pleaſed with his Offerings.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13.</note> The place, for the Pattern, is in the Book of <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> wherein <hi>v.</hi> 11. we read of the covered houſe, with its Porch, Houſes, Treaſuries.

                     <p>In the Buildings of the Outward Court were the Chambers and Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Levites</hi> eſpecially in thoſe near the Gates,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.27.</note> where their Offices lay.

                        <hi>Mattathiah</hi> (the firſt-born of <hi>Shallum</hi>) with his Brethren, was Porter at the Eaſt-Gate, and his Office pertained to things made in Pans. So that the Paſtry-Office, it ſhould ſeem, was in ſome Rooms of the Eaſt-Gate of the Inner-Court.</p>
                     <p>Others were appointed over the Shew-Bread. The place whereof, under the ſecond Temple, was in <hi>Beth-Mokadh,</hi> and ſo poſſibly under the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Singers alſo, and Players on Inſtruments, had their fixed Chambers, which was under the ſecond, and probably ſo in the firſt-Temple, in <hi>Nit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zotz,</hi> or the Gate of the Song, which was before, called the Gate of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>

There be ſome that think, poſſibly, they were in the Ark till <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time; and then, by Divine Appointment, laid in ſome other place. For why ſhould Scripture ſay expreſly, in two places, they were not in the Ark, ſeeming thereby to imply ſome change,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.9. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 5.10.</note> as to this particular: which if ſo, then the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Tabernacle, may conſiſt more Grammatically with it ſelf, and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if this may be the true mind of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The Golden Cenſer of <hi>Aaron,</hi> alſo, was laid up in ſome place near the Ark, for which the fore-cited Text is as clear as for the other. We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of five Golden Emerods, and five Golden Mice, dedicated by the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> unto God, when they were ſmitten for their ſin; which were put up into a Coffer, and ſent with the Ark, as a Memorial of God's Vengeance, and of their Deliverance.

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:110568:41"/>As to the Golden Altar of Incenſe, it's firſt requiſite to clear it up, that it was placed in the Sanctuary without the Oracle and its Vail. In <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Tabernacle, it's clear, that it had ſtood without the Vail. For <hi>Moſes</hi> having placed the Ark, lets down the Vail, and then places the Table Northward, the Candleſtick Southward, and this Altar before the Vail;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 40, 3, 21, 23, 26.</note> that is, at the upper end of this Room juſt in the middle before the Vail. But a clear Inference we have out of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where, upon the Expiation Day, the High-Prieſt was to take a Cenſer full of Burning-Coals of Fire from off the Altar before the Lord, and his hands full of ſweet Incenſe beaten ſmall, and bring it within the Vail.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Altar ſtood within the Vail, then it were abſurd to ſay thus, that <hi>Aaron</hi> took a Cenſer of Coals from off the Altar within the Vail, and brought it within the Vail. But when as its Poſition was without, it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid, that with theſe prepared things he went from the Altar into the Oracle within the Vail, to burn ſweet Odours. Again the Text ſays, that after the High-Prieſt had done ſprinkling the Mercy Seat, with the blood of the Bullock, and the Goat, 7 times, that he ſhall go out unto the Altar, that is before the Lord, and put blood upon its Horns, and ſprinkle it 7 times. If ſo be then <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt go one of the moſt Holy Place, before he can come to this Altar: It's evident,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.18.</note> that the Altar did not ſtand within the Vail. Thus much I deſired to add, to that common and urgent Argument, of the daily burning of Incenſe by every inferiour Prieſt, in his courſe upon this Altar, who could not have admiſſion within the Oracle, being open onely once a year, and to the High-Prieſt onely on the ſolemn day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. For ſo we find the High-Prieſt, and eighty inferiour Prieſts, with King <hi>Uzziah,</hi> at this <hi>Incenſe-Altar;</hi> who durſt not go into the Oracle, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.17. Now that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar was placed alſo in the Holy Place, appears by the Text alleadged, which ſays it was ſituate by the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, implying, that it was not within it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.22.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing worth anſwering, that I know of, which can be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that foreſaid place of the Apoſtle, where it's ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4.</note> concerning the <hi>Golden Cenſer,</hi> that it was in the moſt Holy Place. To which, I ſay, either it is to be underſtood of that <hi>Cenſer,</hi> that was thus brought into this Oracle within the Vail once a year by the High-Prieſt, and ſo may be truly ſaid to be in the Oracle, though not conſtantly, yet at ſolemn times; or elſe we muſt think of ſome other Interpretation. For whereas this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſome but an evaſion; becauſe the Apoſtle ſeems by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not to note a Temporary, but conſtant poſſeſſion, not onely <hi>ad uſum,</hi> but <hi>ad ſitum:</hi> for that the very ſame word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the ſame verſe, is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Pot of Manna, which, who knows not but continued many 100 years within the Pot. There be ſome, therefore, would expound the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the Altar of Incenſe it ſelf: But are forced to do violence to the word. For in all the Septuagint Bible, I think they cannot manifeſt one place, where it is by them put for the Altar, whoſe <hi>Greek</hi> it's known, that the <hi>New Testament</hi> Pen men chiefly follow. Nay, in its native ſenſe, it ſignifies Incenſe onely, and, by a Metonomy, the <hi>Cenſer</hi> wherein it was put. But to admit a double Trope to ride upon one word, is as harſh, as rare. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to reconcile this place to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> I take it to ſignifie a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer:</hi> For ſo the Epithete <hi>[Golden]</hi> challenges it from its native ſignification of Incenſe: And I humbly conceive, that poſſibly we may underſtand by it the <hi>Cenſer of Aaron,</hi> wherewith he burned Incenſe, when two hundred and fifty men, with their <hi>Cenſers,</hi> were appointed, by God, to try with him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.17.</note> who it was that God had appointed to that Office. After the two hundred
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110568:42"/>
and fifty men were conſumed by Fire,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Ver.</hi> 38.</note> their <hi>Cenſers</hi> were hallowed, and Plates made of them for the Altar, for a ſign to the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now, though the Text in <hi>Numbers</hi> does not tell us that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Cenſer</hi> was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly laid up: yet, if we interpret this place in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of that <hi>Cenſer,</hi> it is no way repugnant to any Scripture, nor to the Analogy of Faith: But helps exceedingly to inlighten and reconcile that place. I am the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to incline to it, becauſe it is joyned with two other things, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Rod:</hi> both which were laid up there, as a token of their Murmuring and Rebellion againſt the Lord, being two miraculous Effects, which God produced preſently, upon their murmuring, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Omnipotent Preſence of the Divine Majeſty, againſt whom, and His inſtituted Miniſters, they had ſo grievouſly murmured. So then, after this grand murmure of <hi>Korah,</hi> there being two Miracles produced; the one, the ſwallowing up of many in the Earth; the other, the burning of two hundred and fifty, by fire, from Heaven: for the remembrance of it, this <hi>Cenſer,</hi> poſſibly, was added, as another Token, together with the <hi>Pot of Manna</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Rod,</hi> to be laid up in the Oracle before the Lord. There is nothing to be objected againſt this ſenſe, but that becauſe the <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> is omitted, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. therefore it's brought in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be within the ſecond Vail, <hi>quoad uſum,</hi> onely. To this I anſwer, That the Altar ſtanding without the Vail, <hi>Aaron</hi> might take this <hi>Golden Cenſer</hi> that lay within the Vail, and with it taking Fire-Coals off the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and Incenſe in his hands, come and perfume the moſt Holy Place. I dare not be peremptory, in this point; although that a certain <hi>Golden Cenſer</hi> lay in the Oracle, conſtantly within the Vail, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms of the Apoſtle, is the mind of Learned Mr. <hi>Weemſe,</hi> in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the <hi>Ceremonial Laws, pag.</hi> 48. However it be, I ſubmit my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to all ſober and learned perſons; having, I hope, before evinced the true Poſition of the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> to be without, but near the Vail, which we now proceed briefly to deſcribe.</p>

But ſome there be, who would have the meaning to be this, that the Lilly-Work, which hung over the Pillars, was four Cubits deep round about the Chapiters.

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe this Verſe aimes not, at the mention of the Lilly-work on the Pillars: for if it did, then were it ſuperfluous to mention it again, as a particular work by it ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 22.

                  <p>Secondly, if the hole of the Chapiter reſting on the Pillar with this Lilly-work ſuſtaining it, were as large as the Pillar it ſelf, as is affirmed by ſome, to let in the top of the Pillar; and that this Lilly-work on the top of the Pillar, in a circling Border, ſtood out four Cubits in the Porch, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Chapiter, faſtned to the top of the Pillar, then will there ariſe twelve Cubits Diameter, that is, four of the Pillar, and four on each ſide of this Lilly-work, and ſo the pillars will be ſhut out of the Porch, which was but ten Cubits broad, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p>On the top of the Pillars then were two Chapiters, of five Cubits higher then the Pillars with Nets of Checker-work; and each Pillar had ſeven Wreaths of Chain-work, with two Rowes of Pomegranates; in each Row,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.16. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7.41. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.23. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 4.13. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7.42. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3.15.</note> one hundred; but ninety ſix onely could be ſeen by thoſe that ſtood upon the Pavement of the Porch.

Its Situation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Porch, that is, full Eaſt of it, whereon the Sacrifices were offered to God. The place of it is confirmed by that paſſage of the Prieſt's weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Porch and the Altar. As to the Sacrifices, we read of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtruments that were made for them; as Fleſh-hooks of Gold: alſo Pots, Shovels, and Baſons of bright Braſs. Two things I would add; Firſt, that probably, this Altar was made within of Stone, but unhewen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's command, and placed over with Braſs. Secondly, That whereas God had commanded the Prieſt ſhould not aſcend by ſteps to his Altar, and ſeeing this of ten Cubits was ſo high, as far exceeded the ſtature of the calleſt High-Prieſt: ſome think it was but three Cubits high, as the Altar of <hi>Moſes</hi> was (where, by the way take notice, the ordinary ſtatute of man being but ſix foot, as <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and others, have of old written, that is, about two yards of our meaſure; and this Altar being but a yard and half, we learn ſomething of the quantity of a Cubit; whereof otherwhere) Now that it is ſaid to be ten Cubits high, it is to be underſtood, ſay ſome, in reſpect to the Court of the people, which was ſeven Cubits lower then this of the Prieſts. But I rather incline to think, there was, as under the ſecond Temple, an eaſie aſcent by a declivity on the South ſide, though not by ſteps.</p>

                     <p>Next ſucceeds the Brazen Scaffold, whereof we have given no Icon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or Pictural Figure, becauſe it was not of ſacred uſe in it ſelf,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1. &amp; 38.1.</note> but onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King in his Temple-approaches unto God, As to its Deſcription then it was five Cubits long, five broad, and three high, being exactly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Brazen Altar, I cannot ſay, 'twas the ſame, becauſe the Text ſpeaks expreſly, that <hi>Solomon</hi> made it for to ſtand upon, and kneel in prayer at the ſolemn Dedication of the <hi>Temple.</hi> Neither will I be peremptory, that it ſtood in this Court of the Prieſts: though theſe paſſages of Scripture ſeem to favour it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Author of the Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> acquaints us, that it ſtood in the middeſt of the Court, and that <hi>Solomon</hi> being upon it,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6.13. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> is ſaid to ſtand before the Altar of the Lord: which Altar, together with the Court and Temple, he was now about to hallow with his prayers and ſacrifices. So that, as the Altar of Incenſe is ſaid to be before the Oracle: and the Altar of Braſs before the Porch, that is, Eaſt of them, and nigh to them: ſo this, before the Altar, ſtood Eaſt of it, but nigh unto it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Scripture ſayes, that after prayer (which was made upon this Scaffold) He aroſe from before the Altar, which implyes, his nearneſs to it, according to the uſual <hi>Hebraiſm</hi> of that phraſe.<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.54.</note> Now whereas it may be here objected, that the King being no Prieſt, might not enter into that Court.</p>

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:110568:46"/>I anſwer, though ordinarily he might not, as ſome conceive; yet upon extraordinary ſervice, it's probable <hi>Solomon</hi> might and did. Nay, being at the Dedication, to offer Sacrifices, (that is, by mediation of the Prieſts ſervice) why might not he draw nigh to his Sacrifices, as well as any private man in his particular time of offering up any Sacrifice to God.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.7.

                     <p>To conclude, It is ſuppoſed, that the King's Pillar, mentioned in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Story, was annexed to this Scaffold, whereon the King did ſit or ſtand, or kneel as occaſion was, before the Altar. Of which you may read in the life of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.3.

For if we carefully obſerve the 10th <hi>verſe</hi> we read, that the people, with their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, were placed along by the Temple and the Altar, round about the King: and where ſhould this be, but in the Prieſts Court, where the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Temple, and the Altar ſtood.

Now theſe Wheels did not ſtand two on a ſide, as thoſe of our Chariots and Coaches do: But every of the four ſides of the Baſe had one Wheel annexed to it. Their Axle-Trees are deſcribed to have been joyned to the inferiour part of the body of the Baſe, and that the height of each Wheel was a Cubit and half, that is, the Axis, or middle of the Wheel, was of ſuch a height: So that the whole Wheel, in the higheſt part of its Ring, or Circumference, did equal the Top of the great ſolid Baſe, or nearly thereabouts ſo high, onely conſideration being had to the moderate declining of the ſide-additions, even now mentioned: which height of theirs, muſt needs prove true, if the lower edge of the great Baſe, be granted to have been a Cubit and half above the ground, as was ſaid above. For then the faſtning of the Axle-Tree, upon which the Wheel turns, being conceived to be at the bottome, and ſo to run under the Baſe, will plead an inference, that the Diameter of the Wheels Periphery, will prove to be about 3 Cubits in extent, though
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110568:52"/>
not altogether ſo much, becauſe the Center of the Axis, was ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Bottome of the Baſe, by reaſon of the ſuppoſition of its run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the Baſe in a good maſſie Body of a Cylindrical Form, for the ſuſtentation of the great weight of the Baſe and Laver. So that hence will ariſe this Corollary, that the ſuperiour part or Semi-circle of the Wheel, under the thin Additions, was not all out a Cubit and half high, but did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome Diminution of its ſtature, for the ſake of their Declivity, as above-ſaid. Theſe Wheels being each of them applyed to each of the four ſides of the Baſe, were each of them, as to their exteriour Form or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, much like the Wheel of a Chariot; onely we muſt conceive them to be of more then ordinary thickneſs, in reſpect to their burden, though poſſibly very curiouſly wrought; as <hi>Torniellus, Villalpandus,</hi> and others, have fancied them, their Axle-Trees, Naves, Felloes, and Spokes, being all molten.<note place="margin">

The poſition of theſe four Pillars, being under the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corners of the great and main Baſe; their uſe and end was for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that ponderous Utenſil. For I cannot yet perceive any evincing Reaſon to conclude, that they did exceed the Top of the Baſe, and ſo did under-prop the Lip of the Laver it ſelf, to keep it firm and ſteady: Becauſe, for that end, the Laver bad an upper Baſe of its own, fixed upon the Rows of <hi>Brazen Pillars,</hi> wherein it was ſet, and was in a good meaſure leſs then the breadth of the great Baſe beneath; and was, undoubtedly, for that very end, even for the ſides of the Cauldron, to ſit down in, as in a fixed Seat, while the <hi>Fundus</hi> or <hi>Bottome</hi> of the Cauldron reached down to the Top or Surface of the great Baſe, whereupon its great weight lay. For the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Water's Gravity was in the middle of the Cycloidical Bottom of that Veſſel, the lower ſides of it being compaſſed with the Rails, and carved Borders of Braſs, that yielded a moſt lovely ſhew to all Spectators.

So then, there ſeems to be no need of ſuch Pillars, to run ſo high, becauſe of an upper Baſe, ſufficient enough for that purpoſe, even to keep the Veſſel from tottering. Moreover, inaſmuch as we may obſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Angles of the depending Shelves, to obſtruct the erect Stature of the Pillars, unleſs we ſhould fancy them piercing through the ſeveral cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Shelves, a thing not mentioned or heeded by themſelves, or others, ſeeing the Additions are expreſſed to be round about. Beſides,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 36.</note> there is great need of help underneath, ſeeing the Wheels gave no great ſupply of ſtrength for the ſupport of the Baſe, becauſe their annexion to the four ſides of the Baſe, would produce the meeting of their Axle-Trees underneath the Baſe, in one common place in the middle; unleſs we ſhould conceive round pieces of Braſs to have been moulten together with the Baſe, and to have ſtood out like round knops at the bottom, or lowermoſt edge of the ſides of the Baſe, to be in ſtead of Axle-Trees, which will yield, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, we ſuppoſe, that they were placed on the in ſide of the ſhelving Plates, or Benches, that ſo their ſtanding under the Laver, might be underſtood and interpreted concerning their ſupport of that Veſſel, by mediation, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the grand Baſe.</p>

Lip, ſomething like the Figure exhibited in the preſent Scheme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to this Diſcourſe, which doth indifferently well accord with the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the inferiour upright <hi>Border of Braſs</hi> before deſcribed, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the capacity of its belly: the neck of the Veſſel being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the inward Circular Verge of the Upper-Baſe, and the great tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mouth ſupported by, and over-laid upon the Upper-Border of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits heigth, before deſcribed. So that hence it ſeems, that the large belly of the Veſſel ſhould prove ſomewhat leſs then half a Cubit in height, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was included within the firſt Border, and its Columnes, ſo often mentioned, and (that part, which for diſtinctions ſake we call) the Neck was a Cubit higher; and, laſtly, that the reverting Lip was of ſuch a height and breadth, (as the infuſed quantity of fourty Bathes, mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will permit) which will appear preciſer, upon a more exact examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then can (at preſent) be inſiſted upon. We have therefore, at this time, according to the moſt generally-received Opinion, pitched upon this Conchous Form (if we may preſume, without diſtaſte, ſo to tearm it) as moſt generally agreeing with the Deſcriptions of both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, leaving the more full demonſtration of the truth thereof to another and more proper opportunity, if the Lord ſee good: Seeing this Treatiſe is written in our own Language, and deſigns not ſuch preciſe and accurate determination of theſe particulars; which I would moſt gladly ſee performed by a Learned Pen, and ſhould acknowledge my ſelf greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> in theſe points, hoping that this my ſlender <hi>Eſſay</hi> may ſo far prevail, as to invigorate the <hi>Genius</hi> of ſome nobly-diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; who might with ingenuous Candor, and more elevated Abilities, hold forth to the World the exact Hiſtorical Deſcriptions of Scriptural Things, and Perſons in a more compleat and learned Method. Till which much-long'd for time, I ſhall beg a courteous interpretation, of my poor unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Travels in theſe Curioſities. Wherein, I humbly conceive, it would prove very impertinent, at preſent, to interlard this Diſcourſe with any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tedious Diſquiſition about the Form or outward Figure of this Veſſel now in our hands; reſerving its amplification to another Seaſon and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe about Meaſures, if the Lord permit the uſe of this Temporal Life, and convenient Providences, to finiſh ſome Thoughts upon theſe Subjects: which I ſhould very willingly reſign into the hands of perſons of greater Ability and Leiſure, rejoycing to ſee my ſelf prevented by ſuch a Tract, that might bring forth ſomething to the World, <hi>de novo,</hi> and might tend to the ſatisfaction of diligent Inquirers, and to the improvement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of Learning. Let it ſuffice then at preſent, that the inward capacity of every Laver, is diſtinctly expreſſed to have contained fourty <hi>Bathes</hi> of liquid matter, and that every one of them had a diſtinct Baſis of its own, whereon it was fixed and placed in its proper order.</p>
                     <p>The Situation of theſe ſo famous Utenſils, conſiſting mainly of thoſe two parts, the Baſe and its Laver, or that great maſſie piece of Braſs, of a four-ſquare Form, reſting upon Wheels, and Under-Setters, and bearing thoſe ſtately Ponds upon their proud Backs, were ordered, by God Himſelf, in His Directions to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be on this wiſe. On the North ſide of the Prieſts Court, there were five of them ſetled in a Row, and as many more upon the South, they being ten in number.</p>
                     <p>The end or deſigned uſe of theſe Sacred Veſſels was very conſtant, even for Daily Service, in the Adminiſtration of Water to the Prieſts of that Splendid Temple, who were to waſh the ſeveral parts of the Burnt-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and other the enjoyned Sacrifices, upon the decliving <hi>Shelves of Braſs,</hi> before deſcribed, whereupon the ſeveral Spouts of the Lavers did run at
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110568:54"/>
pleaſure with clear and pure Water, according to the various occaſions of the Sanctuary. Having thus finiſhed the delineation of this Piece, in ſome meaſure, which we find ſo amply and fully; and yet, as to our Tranſlation, ſo intricately laid down in Scripture, we ſhall now wave any further treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Point, and proceed to the other Utenſils in their proper place and order.</p>
                     <p>But as for theſe leſſer Veſſels, Utenſils, Ornaments, ſtanding in, or laid up within the compaſs of this, or the other Court, and the ſeveral Chambers of the Temple, as the Desks and Muſick Books of the Singers, the King's Pillar, all the Veſtments of the Prieſts, the 120 Trumpets, the Slaughter-Knives, and all other Utenſils about the Sacrifices; the Inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, the Standards of all Meaſures, the Armory of all Weapons; as Spears, Bucklers and Shields, &amp;c. The Repoſitories for Wood, Salt, Tythes, Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; the Treaſury Chambers; the Water, or Well-Rooms; the Lodgings of the Prieſts and Levites, that attended on the Holy Service in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; their Deſcription cannot be manifeſted out of Scripture. Were we to deſcribe the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> we might be ſupplyed by the learned induſtry of many Forreiners, both Jews and Chriſtians; but eſpecially of thoſe two learned Levites of our own Nation, Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fuller;</hi> to whoſe great pains, the Common-wealth of Learning is deeply obliged: having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us better Deſcriptions of the Temple, then any High-Prieſt of the Jews ever did. But ſeeing we mainly inſiſt upon the Delineation of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, let it at preſent ſuffice, that the fore-mentioned things were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and moſt exactly diſpoſed, though it hath not pleaſed the Holy Spirit to tranſmit their accurate Deſcriptions to Poſterity; while we, in the mean time, remain content, not to be wiſe above what is written.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Levites,</hi> diſtinctly ſo called, were not Prieſts, but ſuch as came from the ſtemme or root of <hi>Levi,</hi> excepting the Children of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Theſe perſons were appointed to wait upon the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> in the Courts and in the Chambers,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.28, 29. &amp;c.</note> in the purifying of all the holy things, and the work of the ſervice of the houſe of God: Both for the Shew-bread, and for the fine flower, for Meat-Offerings, and the unleavened Cakes, and for things baked in Pans or fryed, and for all manner of Meaſure and Cize, (a good preſident, to learne us of what ſacred eſtimation we ſhould account, and what diligent care we ſhould take in the conſervation of the ſtandard Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; for the adminiſtration of commutative Juſtice) they were alſo to ſtand every Morning to thank and praiſe the Lord, and likewiſe at Evening. Yea, and to offer all burnt ſacrifices unto the Lord, (that is, to aſſiſt the Prieſts in caſe of multitude of Offerings, ſuch as were extraordinary) in the Sabbaths, new Moons, and Set-Feaſts, by number, according to the order commanded them, continually before the Lord. And that they ſhould keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and of the holy place, and of the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> their brethren, in the Service of the houſe of the Lord. For which end they were at firſt numbred at the age of thirty years,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.26, 27. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the latter end of King <hi>David</hi>'s reign was computed at thirty eight thouſand; whereof twenty four thouſand were ſet off for the work and buſineſſe of the holy Houſe: Six thouſand to be Officers and Judges: four thouſand were Porters, and four thouſand were Singers and Players upon Inſtruments. So that the work of the <hi>Levites</hi> was mainly Templar, which lay within the precincts of the Temple: and partly provincial, as the devout <hi>Sr. H. Spelman</hi> ranks them.<note place="margin">

They were not in any caſe to approach near the Veſſels of the Sanctuary, no nor of the Altar, in any way of Miniſtration after the Nature of Prieſts, unleſſe in caſe of neceſſity, when the number of the Prieſts was not ſufficient for the greatneſſe of ſome feſtivall ſolemnity, then we have an inſtance of the <hi>Levites</hi> helping them to flay the burnt Offerings,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 29.34.</note> till the work was ended: Elſe they might not.

Wherefore in <hi>David</hi>'s time there ſeems to have been a double error committed about the Ark. The firſt was in carting that moſt holy and myſterious piece. For although the Philiſtines did ſend it home upon a new Cart toward <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> without enſuing danger; yet the <hi>Iſraëlites</hi> might not dare to deal ſo irreverently with that rare ſymbole of the divine preſence,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.11.</note> as to ſet it on a homely Cart, if they diligently conſulted the

So tender and jealous is the Lord of Hoſts of every point of his inſtituted Worſhip, which might make us extream wary and watchfull how we draw nigh to God under Ordinances, even in the Goſpell-daies, wherein though the ceremoniality of Worſhip is not ſo ſtrict, yet the ſpirituality is far more advanced, and we are to draw neere with hearts more heavenly &amp; abſtracted from the impurities of the world, and it is dangerous dallying with his divine Majeſty, in uſing any traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rites, or ceremoniall inventions of man in his ſolemn ſervice, being never ſo fairely coloured and varniſhed over with the ſpecious pretences of decorum, unity, order, Church diſcipline, and peace.

For in vain do we worſhip, if we teach the Commandements of men for the Doctrines of God: either to gratify the carnall Humours of Perſons wedded to and ſoaked in the poyſonous Cup of Romiſh ſuperſtitions: or to carry on a magiſteriall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of being Lords of our Brethrens Faith and Practiſes, by impoſing Dictator-like upon others conſciences in punctilio's of externalls and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeſſentialls to Salvation: When as probably enough their opinions in thoſe niceties have no more ſolid reaſons grounded upon Scripture (the ſole rule of Faith, Worſhip, and Manners) to evince their practiſe to be ſober and judicious; than the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath of title to his Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or univerſall Head-ſhip, from the Donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or the cruel <hi>Phocas</hi> of the Eaſtern Empire.

                        <p>By this ſhort <hi>Scheme,</hi> though imperfect, for want of Scripture-Light, we may perceive how highly God was pleaſed to honour the Poſterity of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in beſtowing upon them mainly, the chief Truſt of the Treaſures of his Houſe. Let us here remember, that theſe Overſeers, and Guardees of the Treaſuries, were reckoned among the Porters, as having the diſtinct charge of the Chambers, Doors, and Cheſts of the Treaſures. For it is expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that the four chief Porters had the over-ſight of the Chambers, or Store-Houſes, and the Treaſuries of the Houſe of God, intruſted with them. Moreover,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 9.26. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.15, 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.24.</note> we may obſerve, that the Sons of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> (known Porters) had the houſe of <hi>Aſuppim,</hi> or the Gatherings, as well as of the little Gates, at each end of the Houſe, committed to them, being the ſame Treaſures that were robbed by the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the days of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> Laſtly, it appears by that paſſage in the time of King <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Reformation, which acquaints us, that <hi>Core,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Imnah</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite (the Porter toward the Eaſt) was over the Free-will Offering of God,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.14.</note> to diſtribute the Oblations of the Lord, and the moſt Holy Things.</p>
                        <p>So that it appears, that the Treaſurers and Overſeers of the Dedicate Things, are to be computed among the Porters, but of a higher Rank, then the ordinary Ones, that came in and out by turns to wait at the Gates, to open and ſhut, and watch at them day and night. For ſome we find em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in taking the charge of the miniſtring Veſſels, and bringing them

One had his Office over things made in Pans; others, over the Shew-Bread, to prepare it for the Sabbath; and others, in other diverſe and various Employments of this nature. But enough of theſe: let us proceed to the Judges of the Nation, that were of this Levitical Tribe.</p>

                        <p>BEſides the Singers, Porters, and Treaſurers, there were alſo Judges of this Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> Some whereof had their conſtant reſidence in the Countrey for this Service, and their number (diſtinct from the 24 thouſand that ſet forward the work of the houſe) is reported to have been ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as Officers and Judges. To cut this Diſcourſe ſhort,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.4.</note> we ſhall onely ſpeak to two things, their Linage, and their Office.</p>
                        <p>As to their Linage, its known out of many paſſages of Scripture, that <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Levi,</hi> had four ſons, <hi>Amram, Izhar, Hebron,</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziel.</hi> The Poſterity or Iſſue of which four perſons,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.23.</note> were ſtyled by the Names of their Fathers.</p>
                        <p>The Children of <hi>Izhar</hi> and <hi>Hebron</hi> were ſet apart for this work of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment principally, as to the ſet ſtations. Though probably many hundreds of their Children might be alſo taken up in the immediate ſervice of the Temple, as appears by the Singers of <hi>Hemans</hi> Company, that were the Iffue of <hi>Izhar,</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Genealogical Scheme</hi> of the Singers in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages. Neither is it improbable, but that thoſe 24000 who were employed more immediatly in the Temple-Worſhip, (when they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Courſes from their ſervice) did alſo perform this great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn work of Judgment among the people. For they coming in, and going out by ſet-numbers every week in 24 Courſes, did appear but once in 24 weeks at the Temple, unleſs at the three grand Solemnities; and ſo had leiſure ſufficient in their ſeveral Cities and Villages to teach the people the Laws of God, to expound the Letter of the Moral, Ceremonial, and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Parts thereof, and to judge finally in all matters of Controverſie about thoſe Laws, and of their living according to, or the diſobeying of them.</p>
                        <p>Of the <hi>Izharites, Chenaniah</hi> and his ſons were for the outward buſineſs over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for Officers and Judges,<note place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.81.</note> Of the Brethren of <hi>Jerijah,</hi> men of valour, there were 2700 chief Fathers, whom King <hi>David</hi> made Rulers over the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the King.

Eaſt of <hi>Jordan,</hi> poſſibly becauſe of its nearer vicinity to the Court, and the Royal Reſidence, and ſo needed not ſo many, becauſe of the conveniency of their Appeals unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf. As to their Office, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of two places of Scripture will manifeſt the great Dignity of their Employment, and the large extent of their power. In the firſt whereof God himſelf commands, that in matters of difficulty, if any ſtrong Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency did ariſe in Judgment between Blood and Blood, Plea and Plea, Stroke and Stroke, being matters of controverſie, within their Gates, they were appointed to go to the place which God ſhould chooſe, that is, <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> principally,<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>17.8.</hi> &amp;c.</note> and any of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Cities ordinarily, where the Judges had their fixed reſidence, and ſhould come to the Prieſts, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, who ſhould determine in a Sentence of Judgment, and the people were to ſtand to their Deciſions; which if any man preſumptuouſly dared to decline, that man was to be put to death, and evil to be put away from <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Ver.</hi> 10.</note>Beſides, we read in the Hiſtory of King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that He did inſtitute in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Levites and Prieſts, to hear and determine Cauſes for the Judgment of the Lord, and for Controverſies, and charged them, that what Cauſe ſoever did come before them, between Blood and Blood, Law and Commandement, Statutes and Judgments, that they ſhould judicially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them not to treſpaſs againſt the Lord.</p>
                        <p>So that from theſe and other places, it's eaſie to collect, that the Levites were Judges over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the higheſt matters concerning Life or Eſtate, or any other Controverſie between man and man: It being obſerved by ſundry learned Writers, that there was but one Court of Judicature among the Jews, whereof the Levites were the Judges, and the written Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was their Rule: not according to the corrupt Innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in erecting their <hi>Curia Chriſtianitatis,</hi> for the ſecuring of Church-men in all their out-rages from ſecular power, in this and in other Nations, and digeſting of thoſe Dung-Carts, full of Canonical Books (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Civil Law, or the Municipals of each Countrey) enough, by their burden, to ſink a thouſand Aſſes into the River of <hi>Tyber.</hi> But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. To theſe Levites did appertain the Records and Genealogies: For of this Tribe were the Judges, Lawyers, Scribes, Recorders, Genealogiſts, in all matters pertaining to the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, Expoſition of the Laws, Writing out of the Copies of the Holy Books, to be read in the Countrey-Synagogues, the preſervation of the Linage of their Tribes, the determination of Caſes, and laying up the Rolls of the Records, in relation to things Sacred and Civil, either belonging to the King, or any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Inſomuch, that the perſons of the greateſt rank and quality, either for dignity of Office, or Nobility of Perſon age, excepting the Royal Race of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> were of theſe.

                  <p>As to dry Meaſures, there are three onely that we ſhall uſe: The Omer, Ephah, and Homer. Concerning which, we find in Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that ten Omers make an Ephah, and ten Ephahs produce an Homer. By a tenth deal of Flour, ſo often mentioned in the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices,</hi> we underſtand an Omer, which in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and is retained by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who calls this Quantity and Meaſure <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and tells us, that one of theſe Meaſures was equal to 7 Attick cotyla's. Each Cotyla containing 9 Ounces, according to the Learned <hi>Agricola.</hi> This being multiplyed by 7. produces 63 Ounces;<note place="margin">De ponderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuris, lib. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>85.</hi>
                     </note> and that being reduced to pounds of 12 ounces, according to the Medicinal Meaſures of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> leaves in the Quotient 5 <hi>li.</hi> and 3 ounces of Attick Meaſures, or 5 pints, (give us leave ſo to ſpeak) and 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>/12, or ¼, for one Omer, or 10th deal of Flour for a meat-offering to every Lamb. Conſequently, ten times as much, that is an Ephah, is 52 <hi>li.</hi> and ½, which being reduced to <hi>Engliſh</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, makes ſix Gallons, one Pottle, and half a pint. So that one Omer was one Pottle, one Pint, and three Ounces of our Meaſure, or very near the matter, though we cannot now ſpend time in reducing the <hi>Attick</hi> pound to our <hi>Engliſh Troy</hi> Weight of 12 ounces, 8 pounds whereof makes an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gallon, according to the Statute of the 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to liquid Meaſures, there are three onely that we have need to meddle with; the Log, Hin, and Bath: of which, one Log contained ſix Eggs, that is, as much Water as ran out of a Veſſel whereinto 6 Eggs were put, after it was filled unto the brim:<note place="margin">Schindler.</note> or, as others, the content of 6 Egg-ſhells. Secondly, a Hin contained 72 Eggs, or 12 Logs:<note place="margin">Buxtorf.</note> ſo that in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-meaſures mentioned in Scripture, (importing, that there were Veſſels of ſuch a content as followeth) The fourth part of a Hin is three Logs. The third part is four Logs; half a Hin, ſix Logs; and three quarters, nine Logs.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, laſtly, ſix Hins fill up a Bath. Now for Reduction to our Meaſures, as in the dry Meaſures, we pitch upon the Aſſaron, or tenth deal, becauſe moſt uſed in this preſent Sacrifice Story: ſo we will now pitch upon the Hin, which with its parts is the meaſure frequently mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this buſineſs. As to this, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (I will not ſay how truly and punctually) comparing the Hin with <hi>Attick</hi> Meaſures, tells us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 88. D.</note> it was equal to two of thoſe Meaſures, which the <hi>Athenians</hi> termed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which by the Commentator upon <hi>Nicander,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and afterwards <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. A Chus is ſix Sextaties, and a Sextary contains one <hi>li.</hi> and ½, whence we lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, that one Chus is 9 <hi>li.</hi> and one Hin is 18 <hi>li.</hi> of <hi>Attick,</hi> Meaſure. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there are 108 pounds in one Bath: and one Log, being the ſeventy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of a Bath, will contain a pint and half, even three times as much as will be produced by ſuch as converſe with Egge-ſhels. But, indeed, I vehemently ſuſpect <hi>Joſephus,</hi> becauſe (in reaſon) the quantity of Oyl, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this reckoning, for the daily Sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40.</note> being the fourth part of a Hin, or three Logs, comes to one Pottle, and ½ a pint of Oyl, to be mingled with one tenth deal of Flour, which was before ſtated out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> his <hi>Attick Cotyla,</hi> to be one pottle, one pint, and three ounces of Flour, which is incomparably too much for the wetting of Flour to make a Cake, if I do not groſly miſtake in good Houſewifery. For as ſure as can be, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> though a Prieſt, his Office lay not among the Baking-Pans, or elſe he was poorly acquainted with <hi>Attick</hi> meaſures. Wherefore, that we may not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110568:67"/>
marre the Cake in the making, we had better take the meaſure of thoſe that have put the Eggs in the Cakes, and meaſured the Oyl with the ſhells, and they will tell us, that one Log is but half a pint; and ſo the fourth part of a Hin, or a pint and half of Oyl, will ſerve a little better to mix with the Flour.</p>
                  <p>But this way of dealing with Eggs in meaſures, I doubt will make nine meaſures of ten prove addle.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, they tell us not, whether we are to uſe the Eggs of Wrens, Sparrows, Hens, Eagles, or Oſtriches, in this profound Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſuppoſe all Eggs of a kind to be of one bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, they never heed that the Water of the Veſſel, wherein they put their Eggs, will variouſly riſe into a tumour on the ſurface, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from a ſolution of continuity, and that variouſly, more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Eggs be gently or raſhly put in, and ſo yield Water, more or leſs, for your meaſure: they ſhould have done well to have informed us of the proportion of motion in this action. If Phyſitians ſhould have no more care, as to medicinal meaſures: then the Prieſts had in their ſervices towards God, (if this be true) they might quickly ſend Hundreds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients out of this World, before they would go. But one thing more I have to ſay of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and that is, I am afraid he trades a little too deep, and goes too much on the ſcore with the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> For though he tells us other-where, that a Bath is equal to 72 Sextaries; and here, that a Hin is two of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. i.e. 12 Sextaries, and ſo agrees with himſelf, becauſe 6 Hins are 12 <hi>Attick</hi> Sextaries; each whereof contains one pound, ſix ounces: ſo that 72 Sextaries, ariſe to 108 pound for the Bath, as was ſaid before: Yet here lyes the point to be proved, Whether a Bath be ſo much, or not. For ſhall I mind you, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerving the 70. to tranſlate a Bath by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as they have done in ſeveral places, and then taking notice, that an <hi>Athenian</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Nicandri-Scholiast ad calcem.</note> was 72 Sextaries: He tells us, without any more ado, that a Bath was ſo alſo. Whereas the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> whether wilfully, or ignorantly; or as a matter not worthy of ſuch exactneſs and curioſity, (if we have their true Copy) do tranſlate the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Batim,</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and the Log alſo they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.<note place="margin">Kircher Concordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> So that if you will heedleſly follow them, a Bath and a Log ſhall be all one meaſure, according to the laſt mentioned Verſion of a Cotyla. Wherefore, at preſent, we ſhall take this courſe. Firſt, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that a Bath, and an Ephab, are ſtated to be of equal meaſure, as to capacity:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.14.</note> though the matters contained (the one being liquid, the other dry) differ greatly in weight; which is neither the ſenſe of that place, nor our preſent inquiry. But ſeeing that <hi>Joſephus</hi> (as 'tis above-written) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own account, not medling with the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> hath framed a word of his own for an Omer, or the tenth part of an Ephah, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not uſed by them; and that it ſeems alſo upon other accounts, that quantity comes nigh the truth, as may be ſhewn (God willing) hereafter. We will accordingly, ſtate the Bath according to God's Command, equal in capacity to the Ephah; which is 52 pints, and ½, or 6 Gallons, one Pottle, and ½ a pint for a whole Bath: and then the ſixth part of a Bath, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Hin will be one Gallon, and three Quarters of a pint; and the twelfth part of an Hin, or one Log, will be ⅔ of a Pint, and ¾ of an Ounce, that is, three quarters of a pint, wanting but the fourth part of an ounce, or eight ounces, and three fourths of an ounce. Two Logs are equal to one pint, 5 ounces, and ½: three Logs to one quart, two ounces, and ¼ of an ounce: four Logs to one quart, and 11 ounces: ſix Logs to one Pottle, four ounces, and ½ an ounce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:110568:67"/>And laſtly, the proportion of Oyl for to mingle with the Flour, for the Cake of the Daily Sacrifice, being the fourth part of a Hin, or three Logs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40.</note> will prove (you ſee) to be one quart, two ounces, and a quarter of Oyl, <hi>i. e.</hi> almoſt a quarter of a pint.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I done with this particular of Meaſures, as far as we have uſe of it at preſent; onely I beg of the courteous and ingenuous Reader, to uſe one Caution, that in the reduction of <hi>Attick,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> pounds, to ours, they would not ſtrictly interpret me: which as to an exact and accurate proportion, is the buſineſs of another Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now then to recount the ſervice of the Prieſts in the Temple, we read that <hi>David</hi> gave to his Son a perfect Liſt of all the parts of their Duty:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.13.</note> which Account being not extant in any one ſingle place of Scripture, we muſt have recourſe to the various places where they be ſcattered up and down in the ſacred leaves.</p>
                  <p>To proceed then, we ſhall obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the conſtant ſervice, without intermiſſion, was that of the Porters, who were appointed to watch at the Temple-Gates,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.5.</note> day and night, by courſes; and their number we find to be four thouſand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the daily ſervice was ſpent in the ſacrificing of a Lamb, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, with a meat-offering, that is, a Cake made of the tenth part of an Ephah, that is, an Omer of Flour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38, <hi>&amp;c. Numb.</hi> 28.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> mingled with the fourth part of a Hin, that is, three Logs of Oyl, together with a Drink-offering, which was the fourth part of a Hin, or three Logs of Wine. This was done in the Court of the Prieſts. But within the Temple, the Lamps of the Golden Candleſticks were to be dreſſed and ſupplyed with Oyl, morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and, at both thoſe times, ſweet Incenſe was to be burnt upon the Golden Altar, to cauſe a fragrant odour throughout the Temple. Though I know that an eminently learned man of our Nation, I mean Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Hart, Pag.</hi> 492, and 495. is of the mind, that the Lamps did not burn all day long, but were lighted at Evening onely, and kept light all, or the greateſt part of the night: yet is it conceived by others, upon the account of the narrowneſs of the Windows admitting but little light, that the Lamps did burn continually,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7, 8.</note> eſpecially ſince there is expreſs mention made of the dreſſing the Lamps every morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7. But we ſhall ſubmit in this to the more Learned, in theſe ancient Rites of the Temple: onely obſerving, that the Songs of the Temple were ſolemnized at the time of the burning of Incenſe; as is hinted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9. and that at this time of Incenſe, the people uſed to pray without, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.9, 10. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that this Muſical Harmony was celebrated at the time of Sacrifice, as we have other where obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Weekly Service was performed on every Sabbath,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.9, 10.</note> which was double to the Daily; beſides the Daily in every fore-mentioned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the Monethly Service was celebrated on every New Moon, or firſt day of every Moneth;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.11-16.</note> and had for a Burnt-Offering two young Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, one Ram, ſeven Lambs, and one Kid of the Goats, for a Sin-Offering. The Meat-Offering was three Omers of Flour, mingled with Oyl propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; as in the Daily Service, three Logs to an Omer, that is, three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Hin for every Bullock, and two Omers of Flour, and half an Hin for the Ram. The Drink-Offering was half a Hin of Wine for each Bullock, and the third part of a Hin, or four Logs for the Ram; and for every Lamb a Meat-Offering, and Drink-Offering of the ſame quantities, as uſually in the Daily Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:110568:68"/>All this was offered on the New-Moon, beſides the continual Burnt-Offerings of two Lambs with their Cakes and Wine.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, let us treat of the Annual Feſtivities, which were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally three whereof in their diſtinct order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Paſsover, which ſell out upon the 14th day of the firſt moneth, wherein every Houſhold eat a Lamb,<note place="margin">

But theſe Offerings being particular, according to the multitude of Perſons and Families, we cannot bring them unto a certain account. The next day (after the ſolemn ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Paſchal Lamb, on the Evening of the 14th day,) being the 15th of the firſt moneth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.16-26.</note> began the Temple-Sacrifices for 7 days together, every day alike; each day having as many Sacrifices, as the New Moon had; whereof before.</p>

                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 27-31. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.12, 13.</note>Secondly, The Feaſt of Firſt-Fruits, anſwering to our Pentecoſt, had the very ſame Offerings with the New-Moon. Beſides, one He-Lamb, and two Omers of Flour and Oyl accordingly; and but the fourth part of a Hin of Wine being the morrow after the Sabbath of Firſt-Fruits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Feaſts of the 7th Moneth, on the firſt day of which Moneth were offered one Bullock, one Ram, 7 Lambs, and one Kid, with their meat-offerings,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.2-7.</note> and drink-offerings proportionably, as before; beſides the uſuall offerings of an ordinary New-Moon, and of the Daily Service. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, on the 10th day of the 7th moneth, juſt as much as on the firſt day, was preſented to God upon his Altar.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ver.</hi> 7-12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the firſt day of the 7th moneth, there were Offerings for 7 days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, on this wiſe following.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of theſe 7 days, 13 young Bullocks, two Rams, 14 Lambs, and one Kid for a Sin-Offering, with their meat-offerings, and drink-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, as before; beſides the daily offerings.</p>
                  <p>On the ſecond day but 12 Bullocks, all the reſt alike. On the third day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.39.</note> juſt as much as on the New Moon; and all theſe conſtantly every year; beſides the Vows, the Free-will Offerings, and Peace-Offerings, which were great expences in Worſhip; beſides the Red-Cow, and all the Paſsover Lambs, and all the Frankincenſe Salt and Firing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I will now give you in a Catalogue of all the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Offerings in one Year: in which Year I ſhall count 365 days, 52 Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and 13 New-Moons: though I know the <hi>Julian</hi> Year differs from the Judaical Calendar; yet by reaſon of the Jewiſh Intercalations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating their years thereby, there will be no great difference, when ſeveral years be compared together.

But Treſpaſs-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were then brought: when the committer of ſuch a ſinfull action did not clearly underſtand or perfectly know, that was forbidden by the Law, or at leaſt had at the time of his perpetration of the act ſheerely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten its prohibition. So that it is obſervable, that forgetfulneſs is not mentioned as to thoſe Crimes for which the Sin-offering was to expiate, but in the caſe of Trepaſs-offerings: as may be obſerved <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.2, 3.

                     <p>To conclude then, The Sin-offerings did purge the Perſon and take off his guiltineſs as to ſins of pure and unwilfull Ignorance. The Treſpaſs-offering was to remove the guilt of ſins committed knowingly but through infirmity: and not with the full career and conſent of the Will in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way againſt Gods Commandments. For ſuch a ſin was called Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and (as was ſaid before) had no Sacrifice allotted to it.</p>
                     <p>As a Corollary then we may note briefly, That the Treſpaſs-offering was appointed to expiate greater and groſſer ſins then the former, as may appear by their Catalogue, and ſome expreſſions mentioned in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall, whereof in the following Liſt here exhibited.</p>

                     <p>The manner of this meat-offering (to put a period to this Section) was on this wiſe. Firſt, there was fine Flour prepared; then a <hi>quantum ſufficit,</hi>

The general proportion (as is above remembred) was this; to every tenth Deal, or Omer of Flour, there was the fourth part of a Hin of Oyl to be meaſured out. The quantity of Frankincenſe I do not find mentioned; unleſs we could bring forth the exact quantities of the capacity of thoſe Veſſels offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the 12 Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at the Dedication of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.13, 14.</note> It's known among us, by the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. that the weight of ſeveral of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, is commanded to be of ſuch a quantity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of its inward content or capacity. I know not whether there were ſuch exactneſs uſed of old among the Jews: or, at leaſt, whether theſe Veſſels of the Princes were not <hi>ad arbitrium,</hi> and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any Standard-Veſſels, in their capacity. If there were any preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their frame, as it ſhould ſeem there was, becauſe they did offer juſt ſo much fine Flour and Oyl, according to ſo many Lambs and Bullocks; which quantity, was ſtated by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law: Then there will appear ſome proportion of the Incenſe to the Meat-offering. For if you obſerve,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.13.</note> there was one Silver Charger, whoſe Weight was a hundred and thirty ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels, and one Silver Bowl of 70 ſhekels, both fill'd with fine Flour, mingled with Oyl: which arrives to two hundred ſhekels, that makes at half an Ounce. <hi>Troy</hi> the ſhekel (according to a laxe acception) an hundred Ounces in Weight. The Veſſel of Incenſe, which we tranſlate a Spoon, was but ten ſhekels, or five ounces in Weight. All theſe three Veſſels were full,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 14.</note> ſays the Text: the firſt two, of fine Flour and Oyl: the laſt, of Incenſe. Now if the ſame proportion between the Weight of each, did extend alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene between the Content of each: which, though I confeſs there is no ſolid ground for, yet ſome Neighbouring probability give us leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge at preſent in this Point; then it will be as two hundred to ten, or as eight pound four ounces, to five ounces, that is, where there was ſo much as eight pound four ounces in Flour and Oyl, expended in Meat-offerings, there was five ounces of Frankincenſe, to yield a fragrant ſavour upon Gods Altar. He that is more at leiſure, may count all the Sacrifices of each Prince, and proportion the quantities of Flour and Oyl, according to the rule often mentioned; and then ſay, According as the Weight of the two Veſſels, to the Meaſures of the contained Meat-offering, ſo poſſibly was the Weight of the Spoon to the Frankincenſe contained: which was adhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proportionably to ſuch Offerings. But to leave conjectural uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the confection or making of the Incenſe, we read to be of Stacte,<note place="margin">

                     </note>In the 12th, and laſt place, we ſhall add what <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that they were free from all Military Service, unleſs it were to blow the Trumpets, as was obſerved before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Particulars of the Revenues and Duties incumbent upon the people for the Temple and its Officers, which was a noble and ſplendid maintenance, befitting ſuch a Royal Prieſthood. Indeed, it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient they ſhould have ſufficient, leſt wanting Neceſſaries, they ſhould be compell'd to imploy themſelves in ſordid Affairs, for maintenance of their families, and ſupport of their Poſterity, and ſo ſhould negligently handle Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Matters. Nay, it was proper they ſhould have a plentiful maintenance, that they and their Temple-Services might not be obnoxious to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of mean and unworthy perſons, ſuch as is the generality of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty, who eſteem neither Magiſtracy nor Miniſtery, if not attended with Honours and Revenues above the Vulgar Sphere. Wherefore, the All-wiſe Majeſty of Heaven contrived moſt amply for this His Miniſteriall Tribe that waited upon His Altar: For if you put all the fore-mentioned ſums together, there will ariſe a Revenue for the Temple, and its Officers, above four times as much as fell to the Lot of tho richeſt Tribe in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us, to this purpoſe, view the numbers of the Levites, compared with the reſt of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, when all theſe Revenues were appointed them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.45, 46. Dr. <hi>Edward Reynolds,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>p.</hi> 477.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt of all we read that the number of the Males of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was 603550. from twenty years old and upward. Now we may ſafely conjecture, there were half as many more under twenty, if not full out. For where one man out-lives twenty years, many times two for one dye before that age; it may be more, if the Providence of God in that kind were exactly attended: but let us give in but half, that is, 301775 perſons, which makes the whole ſum to be 905325, the ſum of the other Tribes. But all the Levites being numbred from a moneth old and upward, aroſe but to a ſum of twenty two thouſand.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 3.39.</note> By which, if you divide the fore-going number of the people, the Quotient gives you <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: ſo that the Levites were not equal in number to the 41 part of the people. Now one would think they could expect in Equity but the one and fourtieth part of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that aroſe from the Revenues of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But you will find, they together with the Temple had four times as much as the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt and fatteſt Tribe in the <hi>Land of Promiſe;</hi> which muſt be needs above the third part of the Income of the whole Countrey. Nay, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſionary Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ſacred Portion ſeems to be the third part of the Land. For if we obſerve, the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to have been but five thouſand Reeds broad, and twenty five thouſand long, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.6. which cannot be underſtood of the City, which was to be but ſquare four thouſand, five hundred, <hi>c.</hi> 48.30. And being compared with the Portion of the Prieſts and Levites, conſidering alſo what fell to the Prince: it is conceived by ſome, that the third part of the Land was theirs; ſhewing the ample Proviſion which God determined made for the Goſpel-days.</p>
                  <p>From all this Diſcourſe will clearly follow, an inference of great ſhame to many Chriſtian Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> who allow more ample mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to very mean and inferiour Officers in the State, Civil and Military,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110568:79"/>
then to the very Captains in the Spiritual Army; who, for want of due ſupplies, are generally conſtrained, to their grief, to walk <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and contrary to their own Doctrine of Hoſpitality; many times, after their own departure, expoſing their neareſt Relations to ſtand in need of others Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality to the great diſhonour of God, and true Religion. Nay, ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries many times compel the Stewards of God's lively Oracles, to ſerve Tables, and the Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of Faith, (not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide like men for their own Houſholds) even practically to deny the Faith, &amp; unwillingly to prove worſe then Infidels.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> Whereas it is but equal by the Law of Nature, that the Embaſſadors of moſt joyful Tydings (ſuch as is the Goſpel, and the New Covenant of Grace) ſhould have the moſt plentifull Rewards: when as the Legal Meſſengers brought News of a fiery Law, and a Yoke of coſtly and inſupportable Ceremonies. Beſides, their Work gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contained outward and bodily labour, which whets the Appetite, and ſtrengthens the Digeſtive Faculty; whileſt the New Teſtament Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a more ſublime Orb, is greatly exhauſtive of the Vital Spirits, which calls for greater and more coſtly Supplies for their refection and ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Let us <hi>in fine,</hi> remember, and beware leſt St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keyes, for want of Oyl; ſhould contract an unſeemly ruſtineſs, and the beautiful Lamps of the Sanctuary, without a ſupply of the Juyce of the Olive, ſhould go out in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, or at leaſt burn exceeding dimly. A ſordid maintenance, for certain, will produce a ruſty and ſordid Miniſtry.

               <p>HEre it is requiſite, for the diſcharge of our duty, as to this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we firſt ſet down the circumſtance of time, wherein this ſtately Work was performed: Wherein to avoid all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, at preſent, We ſhall follow the renowned, pious, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in His fore-cited Annals, <hi>pag.</hi> 58. who places it in the Three Thouſand, Seven Hundred, and Tenth Year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and the Three Thouſand and firſt Year of the World, and ſhews, that it was co-incident with a Year of <hi>Jubilee:</hi> and in the ſeventh Moneth of that year called <hi>Ethanim.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.3.</note> The firſt day whereof (according to his Calculation, though it's greatly diſputed to the contrary) did exactly concur with the 230 <hi>October</hi> of that Julian Year. The Temple was finiſhed in all its parts in ſeven years, and about ſix moneths. For it was firſt founded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the ſecond moneth, 2993. But the Dedication was prorogued to the 8th Year, becauſe of the ſolemnity of the Year of Jubilee, ſayes our Reverend Author.<note place="margin">

We ſhall then, according to His mind preſent this Seaſon in a ſilent Scheme: onely let's remember, it was the 2758 Judaical Year, the Julian Cycle of the Moon five, and the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal three, the Cycle of the Sun that year was 14, the Dominical Letter <hi>D.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Neomenia Tizri,</hi> or firſt day, or New Moon of <hi>Tizri,</hi> called <hi>Ethanim</hi> in thoſe dayes, muſt be <hi>Feriâ Sexta,</hi> or <hi>Friday, Octob.</hi> 23. according to Him.</p>

It would take up more time, then is neceſſary to imploy on this Deſign, if we ſhould ſpend many Lines upon the Reconcilement of various Authors, that treat upon this Point: To which purpoſe, it were very neceſſary to enquire anxiouſly into the exact Julian Year wherein this dedication fell out, a &amp; fterward to calculate the New Moon of <hi>Niſan</hi> out of the beſt Tables, and then to aſſure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the falling out of the New Moon, before or after the Equinoxe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a common or intercalated year.

If I ſhould perform this at preſent, it would ſwell this Treatiſe too much, for which it is not of any great moment to inſiſt; and therefore we ſhall proceed briefly to deſcribe the pompous Solemnity of this Dedication.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place we read, that King <hi>Solomon,</hi> for this rare Feſtival, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Elders, the Heads of the Tribes,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.65.</note> and the chief of the Fathers of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and a mighty Congregation of all the Nation, from the entring in of <hi>Hamath,</hi> to the River of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.7.</note>After this, <hi>Solomon</hi> hallowed the middle of the Court, becauſe the Brazen Altar would have proved inſufficient to contain the multitudes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Offerings.</p>
               <p>The Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being aſſembled, waited upon the King at <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> where the Ark of God's Covenant was yet reſident, which the Prieſts took up upon their ſhoulders:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.3, 4.</note> The Levites, mean while, according to their ſeveral deſigned Ranks, carryed the Tabernacle of Boards and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains wherein the Ark ſtood, with all the Holy Veſſels of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>After this, He turns His face Weſt, again, to the Temple, and the Altar, directing His Eyes ſtedfaſtly towards that Divine Glory, and falling down devoutly upon His Knees,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1,</note> and ſpreading out His Hands toward Heaven, He powrs out a large and Heavenly Prayer before the Majeſty of God, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the Chariot of the Cherubims.</p>

               <p>Now when all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw the Fire from Heaven, and the Glory of GOD upon the Houſe, they bowed themſelves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Payement, worſhipped and praiſed the Lord (with one Voyce) ſaying, <hi>For He is good; for His Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

               <p>I will not ſay, that all the difficulties of this Chain of the Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> as to their particular years, are clearly reſolved by Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers: But that the current and compleat years, being examined by the co-incident Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will produce the Sum Total of their Reigns, at the foot of the Catalogue: I ſuppoſe the Characters of the Temple's diſſolution, by the 11th of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and the 19th of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> will clearly evince: So that we may hence learn, that it ſtood (though not conſtantly in equal beauty and luſtre) under the Reigns of twenty Kings, and one Queen, the ſpace of four hundred and fifteen years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and two hundred eighty five days, or a little above three quarters of a year, as was ſaid in the beginning of the Chapter: Or, if you reckon from the firſt day of its Foundation laid (which as you heard, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatiſe, according to the Learned Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was in the three thouſand ſeven hundredth and 2d Julian Year, <hi>May</hi> 21.) to the four thouſand one hundred twenty ſixth Year, <hi>Aug.</hi> 27. It continued four hundred twenty four years, and ninety eight days compleat; as the ſame Author computes, <hi>pag.</hi> 131.

               <p>I know the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> from their <hi>Pſeudo-Mysterious Cabal,</hi> would fain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the length of its duration, to be four hundred and ten years onely, which they derive moſt learnedly from <hi>Bereſhith,</hi> the firſt word in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> having rare inſpection into the blind Viſions of Letters, and idle Dreams concerning ſyllables. But their <hi>Rabbinical Aſtronomers,</hi> ſoaring yet one Sphere higher, would make us believe, that the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> was at the time of its conflagration, legible in the Heavens, there being eleven Stars then Vertical, which by a <hi>Rabbies</hi> Feskue might be pointed out for to make five Letters; and according to their Canon

of <hi>Abbreviatures,</hi> would yield a man learned in thoſe <hi>Hyper-Aegyptian Hieroglyphicks,</hi> ſome words to premoniſh the Inhabitants of that Cities Ruine.</p>
               <p>But leaving theſe crude Conjectures, to be boiled up to a Romance in the Skull-Pans of thoſe Chymical Divines, we ſhall proceed to mention the Names of the ſeveral High-Prieſts; under whoſe Rule, and by whoſe Guidance, the ſacred Services of the Temple were adminiſtred: whereof we ſhall give in two Platforms; and, in each, three Authors, making up ſix in all; and then produce a Connexion of theſe Authors together, in a ſucceſſive Story: wherein we ſhall endeavour, with all poſſible care and perſpicuity, to untie the difficulties, that have as yet in many things lockt up this part of the ſacred Hiſtory from Vulgar Capacities, or Curſory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of theſe ancient Matters.</p>
               <p>The Authors I ſhall mention and digeſt, are theſe following.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.3.</note> and at <hi>Zion.</hi> Others apprehend it to be meant of ſome notable act, which he performed by virtue of his Office, and apply it to that <hi>Azariah,</hi> who thruſt K. <hi>Uzziah</hi> out of the Temple: But the great diſtance of times will not give way to that Expoſition: Seeing this <hi>Azariah,</hi> (if the two former be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the High-Prieſthood, as to the chief Office) might in the latter days of <hi>Solomon</hi> be of age ſufficient, after the Deceaſe of his Progenitors, to have performed his Work in the Temple, even in that King's days; and alſo in the Reign of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and <hi>Abijah,</hi> (which was but twenty years) and in ſome part of <hi>Aſa</hi>'s Reign. For ſome do apprehend, that <hi>Azariah</hi> and <hi>Johanan,</hi> the third and fourth in this orderly nomination, were of the Line of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> and as Subſtitutes to <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> might aſſiſt them, as ſecondary Prieſts, in time of ſickneſs and ſeparation from ordinary pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according as it was uſual, whereof we have ſpoken before in the Office of the High Prieſts. Now whereas they are called Sons in a Lineal Diſcent, let's remember, that it is uſual in Scripture for ſuch perſons to be ſtyled by the name of Sonnes, by virtue of ſome Office wherein men ſucceed, or attend others. If this be a real truth, then the omiſſion of the two former by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and others, will claim kindred with our Conjecture; and alſo help to fortifie it, concerning their not being the chief High-Prieſts; but as ſecondary, aſſiſtant to,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note> and contemporary with the former. Yet ſeeing Scripture terms them, as lineally begotten one of another, in an orderly way of Generation, I ſhall not be peremptory, but leave the Knot to be ſolved by abler Pens.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Amariah,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Azariah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.3. who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly recorded to have been chief Prieſt in the dayes of King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and to have been over the Jews in all matters of the Lord;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.11.</note> which ſome apprehend to be meant of his being of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Part of his time was ſpent, probably, under the Reign of <hi>Aſa</hi> likewiſe, and that he continued in this Kings days for ſome time. He is the ſame perſon, probably, who by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> is called <hi>Joram,</hi> and by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chronicle <hi>Jehojarib,</hi> though tranſpoſed out of his due place, eſpecially ſince we read of one <hi>Jehoram,</hi> at the Helm of the Prieſthood, in <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s time. Now ſeeing this <hi>Joram</hi> is recounted by <hi>Joſephus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.8.</note> as the fourth from <hi>Zadok</hi> incluſively, having omitted <hi>Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> the ſecond. The laſt (if the fore-mentioned Conjecture ſhould prove true concerning <hi>Johanan,</hi> that he was the ſon of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and that the Line of <hi>Ithamar</hi> was re-introduced to their former dignity, though not to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt place) might then poſſibly fall in contemporary with <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> the firſt. For many times (as we have hinted) we find two High-Prieſts coupled together, though one of them had the greateſt prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence: whereby Scripture and <hi>Joſephus</hi> might be reduced to a tolerable agreement; eſpecially, ſince there be ſome probable apprehenſions, that <hi>Azariah</hi> the ſecond (of that name in the Series of nomination) might have officiated in the latter days of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> according to the ſenſe of Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> in his <hi>Temple-Service, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>line</hi> 1, and 37. which aſſertion would prove very ſtrange, if he were the fourth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from <hi>Zadok,</hi> in the beginning of the Temple-Work in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days; eſpecially ſince <hi>Amariah</hi> (who is expreſly recorded to have been his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour) is definitively laid down in Scripture (as we have ſaid) in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Office, under the Rule and Dominion of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> the 4th King after <hi>Solomon,</hi> there being about ſixty one years from the laſt of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s

reign to the firſt of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s. To conclude then; whereas it might be objected, that <hi>Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> the ſecond, (who are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and others) are diſtinctly mentioned in Scripture, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the precedent, and ſo to be termed their ſons; either we may imagine them to have been but of ſmall duration in a ſucceſſive Line: or rather that they are ſo termed onely <hi>Jure Officii,</hi> being indeed but Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to the others (with whom they were co-incident in time) in ſeveral neceſſary caſes; ſeeing it is ſufficiently known, that thoſe who were not natural ſons, are yet ſtyled by that name, upon account of their ſucceſſion in the Government: which will evidently appear, by comparing together <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi>

                  <p>Having done with the name, let's ſpeak to the nature and eſſence of a Type, which may be comprehended in this Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>A Type is an Arbitrary ſign, repreſenting future and ſpiritual matters by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:110568:96"/>The <hi>Definitum,</hi> or the Subject of the Definition, is term'd a Type, by a metaphor taken from Images, Statues, or Pictures, which are the curious artificial reſemblances of their proper Originals.</p>
                  <p>The Genus in the Definition is a Sign, which being an Adjunct of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Beings, falls under the Category of Relation, and hath the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its relation in Quality. Even ſuch as all Similitudes and Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies truly are, according to the Opinion of the great Philoſopher [or who ever it was that compiled that Book of <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> that commonly goes under his Name, which ſeems to limp, but not on ſo learned a Leg,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Things are ſaid to be like each other, whoſe quality is one and the ſame, or which agree in quality.</p>
                  <p>The Difference of the thing defined, is taken from its ſeveral conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts, which divide and ſeparate it from all other Signes, and are theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 One part of its difference is taken from the Efficient Cauſe, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Arbitrium,</hi> or Free-Will of God Himſelf, who inſtituted and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Types, they receiving their <hi>Eſſe,</hi> or Being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by the fore-appointment of Heaven: Whence may be deduced this enſuing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary.</p>
                  <p>That the proper and genuine Knowledge of Types, together with the ſolid Explication annexed to them, muſt be deduced out of Scripture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which contains the Revelation of the Will of God, in reſpect to their impoſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another part is raiſed from the matter of a Type, which is the thing ſignifying, or repreſenting: or that Subject, wherein the Type doth inhaere, and from which the ſignification is raiſed, in reſpect to the Antitype, that anſwers to it. As for Example, The Ark, the Brazen Altar, the Mercy-Seat, the Shew-Bread, the Candleſticks, or the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Another from the form of a Type. It's <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>eſſe,</hi> or the Formality of its Eſſence and Nature, lying in its impoſed and deſigned ſignification in ſome kind of Analogy, or proportion to and with the Spiritual thing that is ſignified by it. As for Example, The Formality of the Type of the Oracle lies in this, that it ſhould ſignifie and repreſent the Glorious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereinto our High-Prieſt is entred, according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, in His Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Unction of <hi>Aaron</hi> typically ſignified the anointing of the Lord Jeſus with the Oyl of Gladneſs, above his Fellows.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 From the end of a Type: which was appointed, to ſhadow forth the excellent things of the Goſpel, which as to the Jewes in their ſeverall Generations, during their Legal Adminiſtrations, were as yet future, and appeared not upon the Stage of the World in full view, until the <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum eſt,</hi> till our Lord upon the Croſs pronounced, IT IS FINISHED, declaring a full and final abrogation of all thoſe ancient Jewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Though, no doubt, thoſe Jews, who by an Eye of Faith did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt (as ſlain upon the Croſs) in the Types of their Bloody Sacrifices, did ſuck ſome Goſpel-ſweetneſs from them, during that Legal Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe particulars, it clearly follows, that there are in every Type theſe three things mainly and principally to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The matter of the Type, or the thing ſignifying.</item>
                     <item>2. The object of the Type, or the thing ſignified.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:110568:97"/>3. The <hi>Ratio,</hi> or the ſignification interceding betwixt the Type, and its reſpective Antitype.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now becauſe that in all Scriptural Types, their true and native ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation depends upon, and flows from the Divine Will; Therefore muſt we adhibite eſpecial care and diligence in the management of Diſcourſes upon theſe rare and excellent Subjects, and proceed with the moſt preciſe caution, that we attribute and aſcribe nothing by way of prefiguration to any things or perſons whatſoever, but to ſuch as Holy Scripture doth either directly, or by ſtrong and clear conſequence hand forth to us. So that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there may intercede ſome Moral, Phyſical, or Hiſtorical Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy between ſome Legal Materials, and Goſpel-Truths: yet muſt they not therefore preſently be interpreted under the notion of Divine Types, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be ſome fair and probable hint upon rational accounts, deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of Scripture it ſelf for ſuch a conſtruction. Nevertheleſs, it is moſt certain, that the Natural Harmony, and coincidencies of things one with another doth not, cannot obſtruct the interpretation and acceptation of ſuch for Types, if Scripture do but darkly inſinuate them to be of that Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but rather exceedingly promotes, &amp; advances, and inlighten; the Mind in the Conception and entertainment of them for ſuch: Yet neither on the other ſide, doth any ſuch Natural Harmony warrant them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued for Types; unleſs God Himſelf hath ſtampt the Seal of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution upon their Harmony. Who will undoubtedly iſſue forth the Writ of a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> out of the Court of Heaven, againſt all ſuch bold Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into Divine Myſteries, who dare preſume to expound them without a Scripture-Guide. We muſt always remember, to take up <hi>Philip</hi> into the Chariot, when we are reading <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> about the Typical<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32.</note> Lamb that was dumb, before the Shearers, and opened not his mouth. But many of Old have forgotten to take heed to this Cynoſure, or Pole-ſtar, that ſhineth in the dark and ſhady Valleys of the antient Figures, having not lookt back with <hi>Abraham,</hi> at the Voyce of a Divine Angel, to the Ram in the Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, even Chriſt that was held in the Briars of our imputed Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Such were ſome of the antient Allegorizing Fathers: Others, of the School-men; and moſt of the late Myſtical Divines (ſo ſtyled) among the Papiſts. But yet there is no ſound reaſon, why we ſhould ſuſpect ſome things of Old not to have been Types for this cauſe onely, becauſe they carry in their Boſoms ſome Natural Conſanguinity with the Spiritual Subſtances of the Goſpel: in caſe there be any Divine Eradiation beaming from Heaven upon ſuch particulars. For God hath Supream Dominion over all His Creatures, and can uncontrolably, by the Right of Creation, make, alter, and manage them all as He pleaſeth, to His Divine, and Holy Ends. For the Explication of this Point in hand, we may apply ſome part of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Definition of the Soul, recorded by <hi>Laertius</hi> in his life, in theſe words.

Whereas the dewy diſtillings of thin Clouds properly makes the Rain-bow to appear, and therefore is it that many times after a great <hi>April</hi> ſhowre, in the thin Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, when the aire is filled with moiſt vapours, theſe Rain-bows have appeared with their hornes or ends terminating in a vally, and a great hill behind them, as once I obſerved near the River <hi>Tine</hi> in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> From all which we may ſafely conclude, that the Rain-bow is rather an Index of no continuing rain; partly becauſe of thin vapours which cauſe its appearance, and partly becauſe the Sun muſt at the ſame time ſhine; the heaven not being overwhelmed with Clouds.

                  <p>Furthermore, when the divine Majeſty hath expreſly declared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch a perſon, ſuch an edifice, ſuch an utenſil to take upon it the habit of a Type, and hath inſtituted and appointed it to Commemorate ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good thing in the Goſpel: Then may we in general accept of this for a ſafe guide in our procedure to the more particular part of ſuch a great Type, and deſcend further to enquire out the Analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to and with the Goſpel-ſubſtance held forth in them: So be it, the inquiry be managed with great ſobriety, humility, circumſpection, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>From what precedes we may likewiſe inferr, that as to thoſe types which ſignifie upon no other account then <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, by divine choice and deciſion: it is the ſafeſt way and moſt commendable to interpret them, only by what divine Revelations are extant in Scripture, looking directly upon them. As when the Corner ſtone of the Temple is applyed to Chriſt, or the beaten piece of Gold that was the cover of the ſacred Cheſt in the Oracle, called the Mercy-ſeat; is applied to Chriſts mediator-ſhip, and the like. Whereas in thoſe Types, which have any Analogical harmony naturally interceding betwixt them and their reſpective Antitypes, in joynt Connexion with Gods divine inſtitution, ſome more liberty of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliation may be tolerably allowed: ſo be it, they be handled with great diligence, accurate care, and ſubmiſſive inquiries into the natures of ſuch typicall things, and their correſpondents in the Goſpel, according to all their views and habitudes; with a choiſe reſpect had to the Orthodxoy of Faith, the Canon of the Scripture, and the Concurrent Judgment (in the main) of the grave and learned luminaries of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Some perſons have bin very apt to give a plenary indulgence to their own private fancies, and then to applaud and clap their wings at the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread iſſue of their own brains, which generally give little ſatisfaction to any, but themſelves. It was a failing certainly in ſome of the Antients, (let me ſpeak it, with all modeſty and reverence yet had to their learning and ſtrictneſſe of life) as particularly in <hi>Origen, Ambroſe, Bede,</hi> and others, to apply too particular a ſignification to every <hi>nice punctilio</hi> of the ancient Ceremonies. Surely they had <hi>Lynceus</hi> his eyes, (ſuch as <hi>Orpheus</hi> in his <hi>Argonanticks</hi> relates him to have had, wherewith he could ſee croſſe the Ocean) who in every naile, pin, ſtone, ſtaire, knife, pot, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every feather of a ſacrificed bird could diſcerne, I know not what ſtrange diſtinct and peculiar Myſtery.

Some whereof were ordained (as <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> obſerves) for diſtinction of the Jews from Heathens: as the ſituation of the Oracle at the weſt end of the Temple, to diſtinguiſh them from the Fanes of the <hi>Lybians, Aſſyrians, Aegyptians,</hi> and generally of all Heathens, which looked toward the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Vitrvo.

                  <p>I ſhall not therefore be peremptory in any thing, but in that which Scripture it ſelf doth directly lead to. As for others, which hold onely ſome Analogy with the greater, being as ſeveral parts and parcels of them, the intrerpetation whereof may be founded upon common conſequences of reaſon, the like thereto being inſinuated by other ſimilitudes in holy Scripture; ſuch I ſhall with all modeſty and ſubmiſſion propoſe to the conſideration of learned and ingenuous perſons, not valuing the ſick and moroſe cavils of illiterate and ſordid Tempers; who are like the great boaſter in<note n="(b)" place="margin">Noct.

                  <p>Mean while let us conſider, that thoſe Types, which have ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from Scripture it ſelf, for their divine aſſignation; but are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared up out of thoſe ſacred pages, and yet ſeem in their own natures to bear ſome reſemblance to, and hold ſome proportion with the thing ſignified: <hi>Satis eſt</hi> (ſaies<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                  <p>The Types of old were the ſhells; the typified matter, the ſweet ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel within. So that as the faſhion of the kernel is within, ſuch is the external forme of the ſhell without, and accordingly we find it to have bin ſo in Types.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Types are frequently compared to ſhadows: The Typified things then are the bodies from whence theſe ſhadows were projected or caſt. So that the Type is hinted by this ſimilitude, to have bin far inferiour to the body or ſubſtance from whence it was derived: and yet herein we may find ſome dark ſimilitude and reſemblance of that body, whereof it was a ſhadow. For look, even as a ſhadow gives the ſhape of a body ſometimes in equal proportion, according to the poſition of the light, by means of which the ſhadow repreſents the intercepting body: So did the Types ſome of them admirably delineate and effigiate the ſhape of ſpirituall things.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſhadows which attend upon bodies, ſhew forth their motions, either progreſſive, or retrograde, the inclining of the whole, or the flexure of any member according to the various poſtures of the body it ſelf; or elſe are increaſed and diminiſhed according to the various height of the luminary. In like manner ſeeing Chriſt our mediatour is the glorious ſubſtance of both Law and Goſpel, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in the Law his back was upon the Jews; <hi>Moſes</hi> being admitted to behold the<note n="(d)" place="margin">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110568:99"/>
upon him directly, and from his face upon us by reflection, we being now removed from behind Chriſt out of thoſe ancient ſhadows. Our bleſſed Lord the Sun of righteouſneſſe began to ariſe in the <hi>Protevangelium,</hi> or that antient promiſe given forth to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and daily roſe higher and higher in more clear emanations of light upon the hearts of the Patriarchs in fuller promiſes of his coming, till at laſt he aſcended up to the Juſt meridian when he appeared incarnate upon the earth, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as the times dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ions of his incarnation to be more fully cleared up to their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Even as the higher the natural Sun gets towards the appointed eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his noone time glory: ſo do the ſhadows of all bodies decreaſe in their ſtature.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the nearer they are in their poſition to the illuminating body, the more ſtrongly and brightly are they irradiated according to that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreme</hi> of <hi>Vitellio. Omne corpus umbroſum puncto luminoſo propinquius, illuminatur ab illo puncto fortius corpore plus diſtante.</hi> Optic. l. 2. Theor. 22.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in this reſemblance of Types to ſhadows, if we obſerve the ſituation of the groſſe and dark body, we find the ſhadows ſometimes caſt <hi>ab ante, before,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>à parte posticâ, behind:</hi> when the body is fixed and the luminary moveable. In like manner we may ſpeak alluſively of the Jews, as of old ſtanding in the ſhadow that was caſt from behind the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we likewiſe have ſome ſhadows, but they are caſt <hi>ab ante,</hi> from before his face as he is moving forward in his Kingdom of grace: ſuch are the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. For we behold his face in ſome meaſure, reflecting on the ſtate of his incarnation, though palely repreſented in the layer of baptiſme, and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in the wine of His ſupper. The glory of his Divinity and Myſtical head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in heaven, lends us a ſhadow of his meritorious work in the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal repreſentations of his ſufferings, by the Symbols of his body and blood.

                  <p>In all Types there is ſome obſcurity, even as the proper notion of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows lies in the abſence of light from the place obſcured, by the interpoſing and eclipſing body: wherefore the greater diligence is to be given in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the various parts of the ſhadow, with the lines of incidence as they fall from the ſubſtance that intercepts the light.</p>

                  <p>By theſe and many other teſtimonies, the grounds of our former aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be evidently perceived, <hi>viz.</hi> That Goſpel truths were of old typified by the Jewiſh Ceremonies. Concerning the divine meaning whereof, I ſhall endeavour to inquire with all ſobriety, according to theſe ſucceeding Rules or Canons, which contain the ſecond thing propoſed for our diſcourſe, by way of introduction to the main deſign. The hints of ſome things therein contained, I do thankfully acknowledge, as inſinuated by the learned <hi>Placeus</hi> in the fore-touched place.</p>
                  <p>The firſt rule then, for the finding out the nature of Types, or for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of ſuch, as are generally ſuppoſed to be ſo, is this: That when Scripture it ſelf doth expreſly pronounce and conſequently determine ſuch a perſon or thing under the old Law, to be a Type, ſigne, or ſhadow of ſome Goſpel-truth; Then are we ſafe and free from error, and may proceed with comfort in our way towards the Temple, having the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when any perſon or matter in the old Teſtament is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to ſome ſpiritual ſubject, in way of ſtrong alluſion by the pen-men of the new Teſtament: then may we ſafely conclude (eſpecially if the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion be frequent) that there was ſomething Typically deſigned in that thing, by the ſpirit of God in the old Teſtament: although the Scripture do not in ſo many terms or words ſet down, that this of the Goſpel is the antitype of the other in the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when there can be none or ſmall ſatisfaction given in point of reaſon for the exhibition of, or the narration had concerning ſuch or ſuch a piece under the old Teſtament: but what may be more clearly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and deduced from the Myſtical ſignification of its Typical nature, in Relation to an Evangelical object: which being once hinted the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a ſober inquirer begins to have bright &amp; ſatisfactory apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, concerning the intendment of ſuch a relation and the truth laid up in it: Then may ſuch a thing, ſtrengthened with ſuch good probability, (I hope) without any neceſſity of a cenſure, be conſtrued under the nature and notion of a Type.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when there proves ſome admirable Analogy or Proportion, either Moral, Hiſtorical, Phyſical, or Theological, interceding betwixt two things, deeply ſuſpected by the generality of the Learned and Holy, all along ſince the time of Chriſt to have a mutual relation of Typical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment between them; one whereof is mentioned in the old, the other in the new Teſtament, with ſome light glance toward that in the old:
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:110568:101"/>
I hope we may then alſo, ſo it be with due moderation, not fearing rigid aſteriſms in the margin, give to ſuch an ancient perſon or thing the name of a Type: eſpecially ſince grave and ſober men in ſeveral ages, have caſt in their concurrent teſtimony into that interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When there is ſome excellent attribute aſcribed to a perſon or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> matter under the old Law: which according to the meer hiſtory or bare letter of its relation, cannot either natively or tropically, find any clear conveniency or agreement with it: but yet will moſt properly and pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becoincident with ſome ſpiritual perſon or truth in the new Teſtament,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.4, 36.</note> when it is explained and opened, as for example. The Throne of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is promiſed to be eternal: which did neither agree with <hi>Solomon</hi> perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, nor his poſterity; they being caſt out of the Royal ſeat above 2000 years ago: So that it cannot be applied to <hi>Solomon</hi> but Typically as being a peaceable King for a great while; but to Jeſus Chriſt onely really of whoſe<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.44.</note> kingdome there ſhall be no end. In this caſe there will be no need to write, <hi>Type,</hi> over the head of ſuch a thing; the matter is obvious and clear enough, that we may without heſitation inſert it among the reſt of its kindred.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, When the holy Sctipture doth plainly nominate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſome noble or ſacred perſon of old: or ſome grand material of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple, as Typically ſignificant of divine perſons, or things under the new Teſtament: we may then proceed to inquire into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions of ſuch perſons, eſpecially ſuch as were of publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or into the various parcels and pieces, inſcriptions, ornaments, or other appendixes of ſuch grand material; whether or no there may not be found in them ſome conſanguinity, with the more large and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous utenſill, and whether according to its degree and quality, it may not bear an harmonious part in the conſort of Typical muſick: or whether the blood-Royal of a Type may not runne in the Capillary veins of leſſer imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as flowing out of the <hi>vena cava</hi> of the larger pieces of the Temple. For, unleſſe ſuch a ſmaller material be admitted to commence the degree of a Type, (eſpecially when ſome Goſpel truth may properly and without ſtraining be applyed to it, in concomitancy with the greater) there may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly appear ſome chaſm or widening deficiency in the main material; to be challenged by the captious for a blemiſh, and imperfection in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of it, for a typical ſignification of ſpiritual matters.</p>
                  <p>Yet herein, it is not my intention to be critically and anxiouſly inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, into every minute and inconſiderable particle, prying through the microſcope of fancy into the knop of every ſpoon, the faſhion of the ſlaughter knives, the thickneſſe of each cauldron, the ſituation of each veſſel, or the cubital dimenſions of each material, as if ſome rare Myſtery were laid up in their numbers: In which <hi>Ribera,</hi> and ſome others, are too curious in finding out Myſteries, where moſt probably none were intended, and dividing moſt ſubtlely (<gap reason="foreign">

that ſo I may rightly underſtand, and properly expreſſe my conceptions in reference to theſe Myſterious affaires. Secondly, I ſhall cautiouſly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to proceed in this buſineſſe, generally, according to the 6 fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Canons, as to the explication of the nature of theſe excellent Types.

Thirdly, It ſhall be my ſtudy and care to give diligent and deep intention of ſpirit to the things in hand, and yet I deſire to propoſe them with all modeſty and ſobriety; not challenging any determinate aſſertion, unleſſe where Scripture proves exceeding plain and evident: Intreating the Courteous Inquirer to pardon my infirmities, and not to paſſe too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant a cenſure upon the expoſitions, before he have conferred the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications with the preceding Canons, and the opinions of learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines both ancient and modern: to whoſe apprehenſions I freely and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit my ſelf. Fourthly, I ſhall crave leave to acquaint my ingenuous Reader, that it is not the deſigne of this work to enlarge moſt amply upon all the ſignificant parts of the Temple; much leſſe upon all the antient Types and Ceremonies, they being a ſubject matter fit for perſons of deeper inſight and knowledg then I have arrived to. Who having bin much intreated by a neer Relation, (ſomewhat concerned in this peice as at whoſe coſt all the figures were cut in braſſe) to contrive one Chapter concerning the Temple-Myſteries: I was in a good meaſure unwillingly drawn to this work in particular, as indeed to the whole by a ſtrange over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as may poſſibly ſomewhat more appear in the prefixed Epiſtle. Wherefore I humbly and moſt earneſtly entreat the kind interpretation of my poor labours, &amp; the paſſing over my weakneſſes by all learned and ſober perſons: hoping that this ſo thin and ſlender an <hi>Eſſay</hi> may quicken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſome abler quill, taken from ſome <hi>Seraphims</hi> wing, to pierce deeper into the heaven of theſe divine Myſteries, dictated by the all wiſe Majeſty of God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to ſome moderate explication whereof at preſent, that I may proceed in a Methodical path: Let me firſt in general treat a while, concerning the time and place of its erection together with the Famous builder King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who undertooke the care and charges of that Excellent work; and then deſcend to ſpeak to the ſeveral particulars in ſix Sections: that ſo the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Myſteries may be digeſted according to the method of the ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapters, in the Compilement of its Hiſtory: So far fotth, as there is any thing of ſpiritual ſignification in them. All which may be very Commodiouſly reduced to theſe 6 heads following, whereof I ſhall endeavour to diſcourſe with all perſpicuity and convenient brevity.</p>

As we read that all the ſtones of the Temple were wrought with Iron tools by the Art of Maſonry, before they were brought and laid in order and coemented together in the walls of that ſacred Houſe: In like manner the ſtones of the ſpiritual building are hewn and ſquared by the Preaching of the Law, which, as the Apoſtle tells us, is a<note n="(a)" place="margin">

So that as the paſſage or way to the Altar and Sanctuary lay open through thoſe three principal gates: In like manner ſhould the path to the true Sanctuary be madk plain and eaſie, through the wounds of his feet and hands. Whence it is that the brazen Sea, which was ſituated on the Southſide of the Temple near the Altar, ſhould prefigure the water and blood iſſuing out of the right ſide of our bleſſed Lord, for the waſhing away of our ſins, and our ſpiritual ſanctification.

Beſides it is repugnant to found reaſon, to introduce any Secondary and miniſterial foundation, that performs not the true and native duty, and cannot undergo the weight and burden of a proper and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine foundation. For either Chriſt is the only, whole, and ſufficient foundation of his Church, or not.

For if it be a true foundation, it muſt ſubſiſt of it ſelf, and not be laid upon another; as its baſis or bottome. But if not, beſides the flat denial of Scripture by theſe builders,<note n="(b)" place="margin">

The moyſter parts of ſuch exhalations are reſolved into water, near the ſurface of the earth, by reaſon of the cold aire condenſing theſe vapors into drops; (as is ordinarily ſeen in the art of deſtillation) which are the originals of ſprings and fountaines. Whereas, on the other ſide, the more dry exhalations being contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch compact parts of the circumambient earth, as do not eaſily yield channels and paſſages for their tranſpiration; (even as it is in ovens well ſtopt) do in length and continuance of time, as it were bake together into that firme ſolidity, which we ſee in ſtones: being alſo by new aſcending va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours continually increaſed more and more.

                     <p>The covered body of this Sacred Building, I ſhall then proceed to treat of in its three members, or diviſions following. 1. The Porch. 2. The Sanctuary or holy place. 3. The Oracle or holy of holies. Of each in their diſtinct order.</p>

Hence is it, that the Chriſtians of old did worſhip toward the Eaſt, not in imitation of the Heathens whom they abhorred, but in hatred to the Jews their other fatal enemies; who conſtantly worſhipped towards the Weſt, according to the ſite of the Moſaical Tabernacle, and of this Temple of <hi>Solomon.</hi> But to enlarge upon this point any further, I ſhall deferre till I am arrived to the Eaſt gates of the Courts of the Temple, whereof in their due place hereafter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Myſtical ſignification of this preſent part of the building, (now before us); The holy Scripture doth no where inlighten us in diſtinct and expreſſe termes: we muſt herein therefore ſpeak only by permiſſion and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; not willing to paſſe it over in ſilence, becauſe of its Connexion to the Sanctuary, and upon the account of its extraordinary magnificence, being a grand Ornament to the whole building.</p>
                     <p>For if the Sanctuary (which I ſhall endeavour to clear up in the next place) did ſignifie the Church of Chriſt, and Goſpel-communion with God in his holy Ordinances: then may this part of the edifice, as yielding admiſſion into the Sanctuary, be expounded (according the 6th Canon before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) of ſome Goſpel excellencies.</p>
                     <p>For as much then, as the Porch gave acceſſe to thoſe, that were to enter into the Sanctuary or Holy place: who were all to paſſe through this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

                     <p>To proceed, If then the Doors of the Sanctuary ſignified and held forth the admiſſion of Saints into communion with Jeſus Chriſt, by his inward and effectual Call upon their hearts: Give leave for reſemblances in reſpect to the materials of the Doors themſelvs, and the Poſts whereupon they turned; the latter being made of Olive-wood, the former of Firr. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is pleaſed to ſet forth the Excellency of that fellowſhip which Saints enjoy with Chriſt in Ordinances, by participating of the<note n="(a)" place="margin">

But here the caſe is altered; for the fruit of Believers is found of the ſame nature with the Root from whence their Sap is communicated, and according to the Stock into which they are ingrafted and implanted.</p>
                     <p>In this place I ſhall at preſent forbear to ſpeak largely of the nature of the Firr and Olive: Seeing the Materials and Ornaments of the Doors were coincident with thoſe of the Sanctuary within: where I ſhall more copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarge, when once we are entred into that moſt ſacred and ſtately Palace.

                     <p>But for the further beautifying of this holy place, we read, that there were Open-flowers carved upon the Cedar, in a very pleaſant and ſtately manner: which are ſuppoſed to have been formed in<note n="(d)" place="margin">Lightf. 2<hi>d. Temple p.</hi> 81.</note> this wiſe: Throughout both the ſides of the Sanctuary, there were long wreaths of bunches of Flowers and Cornucopiaes, carved in the fragrant Wood, running all along in a Line paralel to the Horizon; and the firſt row of theſe flowered Carvings began probably at the bottom of the Wall near the golden Floor; and, over them, Cherubims and Palm-Trees all along to the end on both ſides. Then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther row of bunching flowers, and then Cherubims and Palm-Trees again, up to the top by the roof, in as many ranks as the bigneſſe of the Figures would permit, and ſuit with the heigth of the Sanctuary.

We have frequent mention of carved and molten works, made like unto Lillyes in the Temple-ſtories: as in the Lip or Border of each of the 10 Lavers; In the turning down of the brim of the Brazen Sea, and in the fair Ornaments which were added to the heads of the two famous Pillars ſtanding within the Porch before the Sanctuary. In reſpect to the preſent Sculptures in hand, As our Text calls them Open-flowers, ſo they might reſemble the hope of the heavenly Glory, which flowres in the hearts of Saints, walking here below in the Ordinances of the Sanctuary. For as the hope of the harveſt lies in the blade, ſo the hope of fruit and ſeed lies in the flowers of a Plant. In that, they were made to reſemble the flowers of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, it ſuits aptly with the frequent alluſions made in Scripture unto Lillies, reſpecting the Church.

                     <p>The ſides of the Sanctuary had three principal, great, and large ornaments; the Palm-Trees, the bunches of open flowers of Lillies, and the Cherubims.

The Scarlet, becauſe it imitates fire, ſignifies the ardor of Charity, and ought to be twice dyed, than not onely God may be loved, but alſo our Brethren. The Purple, which is ſtained with blood, (of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Shell-fiſh) notes the imitation of Chriſts ſufferings, and patience in Labours, and carrying the Croſſe, as <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith, C. 15. The fined twined linnen (as the ſame Author hath it in the ſame place) becauſe it grows out of the Earth with a green ſtalk, and is prepared by the great labour of Artiſts in ſuch manner that, loſing its natural colour, it is reduced to whiteneſs; doth fitly inſinuate the Chaſtiſement of our fleſh, which is to be exerciſed by works of Repentance, and to be thereby tamed, that it may become white and clean. Cherubims are woven in the Velle, that we may ſtudy to imitate the life of Angels, as was ſaid before, and that we ſhould conſtantly make uſe of a great deal of knowledge (as <hi>Bede</hi> ſpeaketh) in the good works which we performe; (For Cherubims ſignifie multitude of knowledge) alwayes looking towards the divine Oracles, and governing our walkings by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, leſt perhaps we ſhould err from the path of vertue.</p>
                        <p>Others there are, who taking the Veile to ſignifie the body of Chriſt, apply the purple to the blood of the Virgin: the elegant weaving, to the working of the holy Spirit: which did frame that excellent variety of his bleſſed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But theſe and the like (though ſome, ſaith the judicious <hi>Rivet</hi> in the forecited place, do wonderfully pleaſe themſelves thereat) are idle fancies, and little to the purpoſe.

However I thought good to mention them, to excite ſober ſpirits to a more full inquiſition, if any Myſtery ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under them.</p>
                        <p>Poſſibly the glorious Embroidery of this curious Veile might ſignifie the diverſe heavenly graces, wherewith our Lord was beautified without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

the rending his bleſſed body upon the Croſſe, (his fleſh being ſignifyed by it) that ſo his holy and ſpotleſſe ſoul, after the giving up of his Spirit to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might enter into Paradiſe.</p>
                        <p>As this Veil did hide the entrance into the Sanctuary; So it ſignified that all things were then covered with ſhadows, and that the Jewiſh Nation was ſeparated from other people, according to the uſual and common apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                        <p>Whereas the Materials are the ſame with thoſe in the Sanctuary we may note, that the excellencies of Saints in Glory are but the full-blown flowers of the buds of Grace; ſhewing that Grace is Glory begun, and Glory is Grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: That Heaven doth not change a Saint <hi>quoad ſpeciem,</hi> in reſpect to his condition, but <hi>quoad gradum,</hi> onely advance him to a ſtate of greater perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in the ſame kind, which ſhall never have end.

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Concerning the Myſteries of the Courts and Buildings, round about the Temple.</head>
                  <p>IN the Hiſtorical diſcourſe we find but two Courts encompaſſing the Temple in the daies of King <hi>Solomon.</hi> The firſt, or neareſt to the <hi>Tectum</hi> or covered-building (treated of in the foregoing Section), was called the Court of the Prieſts, becauſe the rites and ceremonies of Sacrifice were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in performed. The other, called the outer Court, the great Court, or the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was that whereinto the People of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> had free admiſſion, in caſe they were clean according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Some ſpeak of a third Court, common to the Gentiles, and therefore by Chriſtian Writers ſometimes termed the Court of the Gentiles. But it could not be<note n="(d)" place="margin">Dr. Lightf. <hi>Tem. p.</hi> 93.</note> properly ſtyled a Court, becauſe without either Walls or Pavements, containing it ſeems the whole compaſs of Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Gentile Proſelytes might ſtand and worſhip. Some good portion of which ground of the holy Mountain (it is conceived) was encompaſſed with a Wall in the daies of our Saviour, and was the place out of which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15.</note> whipped the buyers and ſellers, ſuch not being ſuppoſed to have had admiſſion into the Court of <hi>Iſraël.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the Goſpel is accordingly applyed to all theſe Courts, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Among which, the outmoſt of all might ſignify Hypocrites and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who appear in external ſhape as ſacred worſhippers ſtanding in the open view of Ordinances. Or rather, (becauſe ſuch Proſelytes might come, ſome of them with ſincere and honeſt intention of heart, to worſhip) it might ſhadow forth the ſtate of ſuch perſons whoſe faces are ſet toward <hi>Zion,</hi> &amp; enquire the way to the Temple in the beginning of the work of converſion. The Court of <hi>Iſraël</hi> may be applyed and accommodated to the faithful Worſhippers under the Goſpel, who are more fully and clearly acquainted with ſpiritual ſervice, and draw nearer to God in divine communion with him, and ſtand in a near enjoyment and fruition of his preſence. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court was open onely to Prieſts and Levites, denoting the Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers under the New Teſtament, who preſent the ſpiritual Sacrifices of Saints unto the Majeſty of heaven, at the ſet-times of worſhip in the publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
                  <p>The body of the Temple had two more principal parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Oracle. Ordinary Prieſts of old were admitted into the former, ſhewing the ſecret ſpiritual communion which the godly Miniſters of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical worſhip do hold and enjoy with his divine Majeſty. From him they receive the bread of life to diſpenſe for the food of Saints. The Lamps of knowledge for illumination of the underſtandings of the faithful, they enlighten at the Golden Candleſticks within the Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary.</p>
                  <p>Their Prayers, being perfumed with the aromatical and fragrant Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, yield forth a ſweet ſmelling favour of reſt at the Altar of Incenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:110568:132"/>Finally into the Holy of Holies, none had acceſs but the High-Prieſt himſelf; ſhewing Chriſts entrance into the Heavens, and mediating at the right hand of the Father for us.</p>
                  <p>There be that conſider only the Court of the Prieſts, and the covered Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this myſtical notion: and apply all to the Heavens and Earth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the great and unſpeakable Myſtery of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe. Such, ſuppoſing the Court (which entertained both Beaſts for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Men for the ſervice) to ſignifie<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pic. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. praef. in Heptap. <hi>p. 4.</hi>
                     </note> this World, and the ſtate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, apply the Sanctuary to the ſtarry Heavens, and the Oracle to the ſupercae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall world. Theſe conceits I ſhall remit to their ſeveral Authours: Others conceive that the Court repreſented the Nations: The Holy place, the Church, and the Oracle figured Heaven: ſo that the Court was a<note n="†" place="margin">Moulin. <hi>Prophecios p.</hi> 403.</note> figure of the State of nature; the holy place, the ſtate of grace, the other of glory. Others would have the Inner Court, (whereinto the Beaſts were brought, and the ſinner having, confeſt his ſins over their heads) ſlain near to, and after burnt upon the Altar: the muſick of the <hi>Levites,</hi> at time of ſacrifice and other ſervices here performed) upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſet forth<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</note> our confeſſion of ſin, praying to God for pardon, the ſlaying of beaſtly luſts, the offering up of ourſelves to God, as living and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſacrifices (thoſe of old being but of unreaſonable and brute Creatures) the works of repentance, and waſhing in the laver of renovation, our ſolemn prayſe to God for his manifold mercies: and, in general, the ſtate of ſuch perſons, as ſince the Revelation of the Word incarnate, do diligently ſerve and worſhip the infinite Eſſence in ſuch Goſpel-Ordinances, as were typified by the ancient Ceremonies ſolemnized within this Court: whereof more particularly (through divine permiſſion in the 5th. Section of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.)</p>
                  <p>Thoſe then which converſed without theſe walls of the immediate Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and reſted only in the outer Court, might poſſibly ſhadow forth ſuch perſons under the new Teſtament, that are not yet emerged or come out of the common ſtate of man by nature: but are yet carnal and unconverted; or, at leaſt, as yet are not arrived into that intimate Communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, neither have ſacrificed and dedicated themſelves to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in holy and cloſe walking; but have ſome general knowledge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conviction, and thereupon begin to look towards, and draw nigh to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip in the ſpiritual Temple. For, as I humbly conceive, the Worſhip of the Jewes, did not only hint at, and ſhadow forth, ſome parts of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall form of Goſpel-worſhip and Ordinances; but did more principally aim at the ſpiritual good things of the new Covenant, which were to be more fully given forth, after the appearing of Chriſt, and the powring out of the ſpirit upon all fleſh in the latter dayes.</p>
                  <p>If ſo be the inner Court (wherein the Prieſts of old performed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts of legal worſhip) did ſet forth, in a ſhadow, the ſtate of the Goſpel-Ordinances, as it ſeemes probable (and ſeeing that it was that very Court, which was neereſt to, and did incompaſs the covered Temple, without any other intermediate encloſure; and whereas the body of the Temple did ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church, the myſtical body of Chriſt). Then might this Court conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (which we are now viewing) exhibit the conſtant attendance of the Evangelical Miniſtry upon the Church; and moreover, that we draw nigh to God's Majeſty in our publick ſervices, through the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Functions. For as, of old, the Sacrifices annexed with Confeſſions and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were mannaged by the Prieſts, whileſt the Song was carried on by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites: ſo under the Goſpel, the publick Worſhip is to be ſolemnized by the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:110568:133"/>
inſtituted Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. So that as the Sanctuary held forth the Communion of the inviſible Church, which ſhe holds with Chriſt in a ſecret inviſible manner, unknown to the World: this Court might further exhibit the Ordinances of the viſible Church, wherein all the profeſſed members (whether of the reall myſtical body of Chriſt, or hypocrites and formaliſts) do joyn; and do all hold an external Communion with God in them, and are under the ſame external and viſible priviledges. Furthermore, (allowing an analogy to what hath bin ſpoken:) The great outward Court, wherein the Jewes worſhipped, might accordingly hold out to us the viſible Profeſſors themſelves, under the New Teſtament, which draw nigh to God in thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which the Goſpel-Miniſters (typified by the Prieſts) do handle and mannage within, in the inner Court. There yet remaineth a Conjecture to be mentioned of that famous and learned Critick of our Nation, Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede,</hi> which I ſhall nakedly propoſe, and reſign up the cenſure unto men that are able, or are ſo immodeſt, as to reflect upon the memory of ſo deſerving a perſon in the Church, as to <hi>Revelation</hi>-Myſteries. This candid and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend man, having reſembled the Temple to Chriſt, thinks there was ſome Chronical Myſtery involved in the Courts, as to the State of the Church, of Chriſt, in various times under the Goſpel; and conceives that the Inner Court might denote the State of the Primitive times under <hi>Rome,</hi> while it was Pagan and Heatheniſh, while ſcorched and burnt in the fire of perſecution, by the cruel Emperors and their Officers. As to which point the Altar in the Prieſts Court, ſeemed to denote the frequent<note n="(h)" place="margin">

                  <p>The ſecond or outward Court, he further conjectures to have been the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the State of the Goſpel under <hi>Rome,</hi> Antichriſtian and Papall, for the ſpace of two and forty moneths. In the menſuration of the Temple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we read of a Precept given, to leave the outward Court unmeaſured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place reſigned up to the Gentiles to tread underfoot, during the time prementioned: In a way of worſhip (ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lightf. Templ.</hi> p. 6.</note> one) (even as the treading of Gods Courts in the like ſenſe is ſpoken of by the Prophet<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſay</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded not to be meaſured, becauſe of the numerous multitude of Worſhippers under the Goſpel, which it could not in the leaſt meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain according to its ancient limits. But to be trodden down (ſaith the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) in way of profane contempt, idolatrous Worſhip, and perſecuting fury againſt ſincere and pure profeſſors of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Suffice it, hitherto to have mentioned ſome Conjectures about the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call meaning of theſe Courts in this our view: wherein I ſhall not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly preſume to let looſe the rains of fancy; but, with all humble ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſober and godly learned, I apprehend the moſt genuine and leaſt forced interpretation of their typical ſignification (if there were any ſet Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry couched in them, as ſuch capacious places) to be briefly this, That as the inward Court was made for the Prieſts therein to perform the rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their ancient ſervice, into which there was no admiſsion granted to the common people, unleſs when they brought a Sacrifice, and were to lay their hands on the head of their offering, and to confeſs their ſins over it: ſo might it poſſibly denote and ſhadow forth a Goſpel-Miniſtry, which in the various functions of the perſons engaged in that ſacred Office, ſhould ſtand in a neerer capacity of ſervice, and approximation to God, then any other calling or perſons whatſoever. Further, as the outward Court contained within its
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:110568:133"/>
preſcript limits, the ancient <hi>ſenes,</hi> when drawing nigh to God, beholding of the Prieſts in their ſervices within, and joyning with them in the ſolemnities of legal worſhip: In like manner, the faithful people of the new Teſtament, the true inward ſpiritual<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.</note> Jewes, are next unto the Miniſtry, in publick and ſolemn Ordinances, wherein they come nigh to God under the Goſpel. Now whereas formerly the Gentiles could not be admitted into the Court of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> but were afar off without the walls of the outward Court: Such might ſhadow forth the ſtate of carnall perſons under the Goſpel, or of formall profeſſors, who give their preſence in ſome meaſure to Ordinances: but as the bodies of them under the old Law ſtood at a great diſtance, ſo the hearts of theſe formaliſts under the new Teſtament, are<note n="(l)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.</note> farre from God. But ſince the outward wall of the great Court (which kept the Gentiles in old time, from intercommuning with the Jewes) is broken down by the coming of Chriſt, who did appear (ſayes holy <hi>Paul</hi>) for this end,<note n="(m)" place="margin">

                  <p>To conclude, It is obſervable, that the great Court whereinto the twelve Tribes did enter of old, was nothing conſiderable in its limits then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what it was ſet out in its circuit by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> (whereof I have ſpoken before Chapt. 3. p. 49.) nay in the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> (as was newly noted) it was left unmeaſured, by reaſon of its quantity, and the great number of worſhippers as ſome have thought. The meaſures mentioned in the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> no doubt (what ever the other may denote) did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the great fulneſs of the Gentiles; and that the compaſs of the Church in Goſpel-dayes, ſhould be marvellouſly extended.

                     <p>Herein, as to the denomination of the right and left ſides of the Cherubim, we are to conceive of it as derived from man, who if he look to the South (as one of theſe in the Viſion) his right hand is toward the Weſt, his left to the Eaſt.</p>

                     <p>But before I proceed to enlarge in this point, I muſt lay one Objection out of the way: wherein ſome labour to ſhew that the four living Creatures in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> and the four beaſts in <hi>John,</hi> are not to be meant of Angels, eſpecially in the laſt, (which they deem parallel to the former); for two Reaſons.</p>

                     <p>To which I anſwer, That it doth not follow, that therefore the four Beaſts are not Angels, becauſe they have not the ſame denomination with the reſt; but the name of Beaſts: For this name is given to them by way of alluſion to the figures of them mentioned in the ancient Viſions of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> which are generally, by the moſt learned Interpreters, expounded of Angels, who, for their Eyes and Wings, their wiſdom, knowledge, and ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that although there is mention made of many Angels round about the Throne beſides theſe: even as in the Temple-Walls there were carved Cherubims, and on the Veil likewiſe; ſuch might denote the wonderful company of theſe winged Meſſengers, that are diſpatcht as miniſtring Spirits for the heirs of ſalvation: yet theſe might denote the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance of ſome of the Angels neerer the Throne; ſuch as did give the ſeven Golden Vials to ſeven other Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.7.</p>

                     <p>To that I anſwer, That the Angels may in ſome ſort count themſelvs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by the benefit of Chriſt's blood, as to conſervation in their Eſtate, being called <hi>elect Angels:</hi>

                     <p>But as to this Rod, further. We do not read expreſly of any leaves it brought forth (though I cannot ſay it did not, yet however by way of alluſion) we may thence obſerve; that as leaves are Emblems of outward profeſſion: ſo the Miniſters ought mainly to take care of bringing forth fruit in themſelves and others: No leaves of a bare formal profeſſion onely but a holy, practical, fruitful life attending their flowring doctrines.</p>
                     <p>This Rod was laid up neer the Ark, which was the Embleme of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; The Mercy-ſeat of Chriſt incarnate, the Cherubins of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the tables of the Law, and all this within the Oracle, the Figure of Heaven.

If thou wouldſt prove a bloſſoming Miniſter, endeavour to keep company with the Ark of Gods preſence. Hence we may infer from the Rods lying near the Ark, that a holy fruitful, flouriſhing Miniſtry is of great eſteem with God.

The Robe of the <hi>Ephod</hi> is termed <hi>Megnil</hi> in the Hebr. and the very ſame word is uſed of Chriſt, that he was clad with a <hi>Megnil</hi> or cloake of Zeal.<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſ.</hi> 59.17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14.</note> Zeal properly &amp; ſtrictly taken, is the Ardor and boiling fervency of all the affections, when alarm'd by the ſuperiour Faculties to perform ſome noble deſign: though indeed its uſually taken for a quick and warm mixture of love and anger, to revenge a friend upon an enemy. But as it is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition or incenſed keenneſs and ſprightlineſs of all the affections: ſo might the various colours in this Pall or cloake of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> ſignifie the great and ardent love that Chriſt bears to his Church in undertaking the great work of the Prieſtly Office on her behalf. Some thought there is, that it might hold out his Prophetical Office: for in all theſe garments there was ſome ſpecial note, and the ſame thing might be hinted by various Symbols to teach the dull ſpirits of the Jews: But why the Prophetical Office is hence gathered, becauſe King <hi>David,</hi> who was a Holy Prophet, wore a linnen <hi>(a) Ephod,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14.</note> who was no Prieſt by extract, but a <hi>Levite,</hi> and conſtituted a Prophet and Prieſt extraordinary upon the death of <hi>Eli,</hi> had, when a little one, a linnen <hi>Ephod;</hi> I ſhall leave to the Authors of that opinion.</p>
                  <p>But generally it was the note of a Prieſt, as is obſerved from the ſtories of <hi>Gideon, Micah, Samuel, Abiah, Doog</hi> and <hi>Abiathar;</hi> and therefore when we find Prieſts with Ephods, its thought it was a Badge and Cognizance of that part of their Office which lay in teaching and inſtructing of the people, when they put on an <hi>Ephod</hi> of linnen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:110568:161"/>But to lay all theſe Conjectures aſide about Common Prieſts, Levites, or Kings, their wearing of Ephods: when as we know by Gods appointment, there were but four garments which the Prieſts themſelves might wear, the Breeches, Coats, Girdles, and Bonnets: this of the Ephod was peculiar to the High Prieſt alone; and therefore who ever uſed it without particular diſpenſation, did preſume againſt God's Command: or elſe, which is the more ſoft ſolution of it, that the Jews had a ſmall light and ſhort garment,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> Orat. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>14.</hi>

                     <hi>without blood there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and Chriſt in his mediation doth impetrate and obtain the pardon of all their ſins for which his blood did ſatisfie:) But to ſhew that the Saints contract impurities even in their moſt holy ſervices. There are no ſins ſo ſmall as to be, in their own nature, venial, No! all ſins are mortal, if God ſhould vindicate his Juſtice upon us according to the guilt of them, and our merit of wrath. But to mind the people of God, even of the leaſt ſins, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts in duty, want of zeal, warmth and fervency in their holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. We want a High-Prieſt even to deprecate God's wrath in behalf of ſuch; For as his death did work out mercy and pardon, for all the ſins of the Elect: So likewiſe doth he continually interpell, and intermediate at the Throne of Grace, for the conſtant iſſuing out of pardons for our daylie weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Another end of the Prieſt's [appearing with his gorgeous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament before God, was, ſaith the forecited Text, <hi>To take away the ſin of their holy gifts,</hi> which they hallowed and conſecrated unto God: To ſhew that in our moſt free will-offerings of Praiſe and Gratitude, there is a mixture of the old leaven of ſin, which muſt be purged out by Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. When the ſoul of a Saint is upon the wing of heavenly influence mounting up to God in its choiſeſt raviſhments of ſpirit, there is a tincture of the fleſh that muſt be expiated by Chriſt's appearance before God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, This Ornament was to be alwayes upon his forefront, eſpecially on the expiation-day (unleſſe when he went into the Holy of Holyes) that the Lord's people may be alwayes accepted of his Majeſty.

                  <p>In the concluſion of this diſcourſe, I might ſpeak a word to that common error, that the High-Prieſt did go into the Oracle or Holy of Holyes, with theſe his ſtately Garments before God on the expiation-day. For the Text in<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Ribera p.</hi> 223.</note> 
                     <hi>Leviticus</hi> expreſly mentions but four Veſtments, and all of linnen, wherewith he was to be arraied on that day. But the manner of his ſervice on that ſolemnity, is to be handled in next Section. Here likewiſe, if time would admit, we might diſcuſſe that queſtion, Whether Goſpel-Miniſters are
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:110568:170"/>
to uſe diſtinct Garments or not? I confeſſe the Enquiry is of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and weight; but for that the Pontificians, and others too much addicted to external Pomp in worſhip, have raiſed ſuch a duſt in the Chriſtian World about theſe and other niceties, impoſing inſupportable yokes upon their weak Brethren, <hi>for</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſmall difficulty of this point lies upon the right ſtating of this Quaery, Whether Church-Rulers have power to take away the indifferency of rhings (which are ſuch in their own nature) by a poſitive Eccleſiaſtical Ordinance? and then it comes to be diſcuſſed under the notion of a Caeremony: But I ſhall forbear, and at preſent onely recite ſome paſſages out of Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> that Learned and Judicious divine, treating upon this very buſineſſe.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rivet in Exod. p. <hi>11. 38.</hi> Edie.

Which with the reſt following I ſhall give in the following tranſlate. God will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by us in Spirit and in Truth; neither doth he at this day require thoſe things which pleaſe the rude and carnal People, or Children detained under pupillage. Wherefore we muſt argue otherwiſe, if the outward Ornament of Prieſts under the old Law were ſo great, how much greater were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſpiritual accompliſhments of Chriſt Jeſus our High-Prieſt. If the Spouſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> under the old Law was ſo gloriouſly adorned with Gold and Jewels; how much more ſhould the Spouſe of Chriſt, (<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</note> who <hi>is all glorious within</hi>) be beautified with all manner of virtues. If the Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Law were clothed with known Garments: how much more ſhould the Miniſters of God under the Goſpel, be adorned with a holy converſation (becoming Godlineſs) and with the knowledge of divine things. Let the Jeſuites hearken to their Pope <hi>Coelestine</hi> in his 2d Epiſtle to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> Chapter the firſt: <hi>We are to be diſtinguiſht from the people or others by Doctrine, not Garments; by converſation, not habit; by the purity of the mind, not clothing. For if we once begin to ſtudy Novelty we ſhall trample under foot our order delivered to us from our Fathers, that we may make room for ſuperſtitions:</hi> This is now done in the Popiſh Dominions. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this manner of arguing from the Veſtments of the Aaronical Prieſt-hood either the Apoſtles were ignorant of, or they provided very ill for the Church; when as they themſelves did not Miniſter holy things, being clothed in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dedicated to that uſe onely: neither have they inſtituted or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be ſo done by others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we (ſaith <hi>Rivet</hi>) do commend an honeſt and convenient habit for Paſtours; and, where the Church may meet freely, do think it comely that the Miniſters of God do uſe that kind of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with modeſty, which becomes Learned Men. Neither do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their ſcrupuloſity or ruſticity that cannot bear it, that a Miniſter ſhould aſcend the Pulpit with a long Cloak, or Gowne.

Indeed the Winter's cold was ſeldom vehement in that Climate: but the Summer's heat might be ſomewhat more offenſive by reaſon of the ſtone-pavements, which might be very hot by the reflection of the Sun-beams.

                  <p>Here, before I conclude, give me leave to treat a while upon the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of ſome perſons, who conceive the 3 ſolemn Feſtivals celebrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians to have been pre-exemplified in thoſe 3 Eminent Feaſts of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>The birth of our Saviour, anſwering to the Feaſt of Tabernacles. For ſo a very Learned man of our Nation, and others, <hi>viz. Beroaldus,</hi>

                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calviſius</hi> conceive, and ſeem to prove it by good arguments, that our Saviour was born in <hi>September,</hi> the time anſwering to the Feaſt of Tabernacles. Our bleſſed Lord when brought forth into the light of this world according to his humane Nature did then, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, make his Tabernacle with men.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for the other, that <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide</hi> did reſemble the Paſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Pentecoſt. But I ſhall not lay ſtreſs upon theſe things. That which is ſomewhat more material for ſuch as do ſacredly obſerve theſe Feſtivals, to conſider, is this: That at this preſent day we have utterly loſt the true time of the celebration of them; and truly a great part of the devotion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by extinguiſht.</p>
                  <p>For as to the uſual and common ſolemnization of the Nativity of Chriſt: though we ſhould grant (contrary to the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and ſeveral learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authors) that our Lord was born on the 25 of <hi>December,</hi> between 1600. and 1700 years ago: yet it may be evident to all that will ſeriouſly weigh the Truth, that we are now ſeveral dayes diſtant, from the ſuppoſed time and point of his birth.</p>
                  <p>For if ſo be the motion of the Sun from one fixed point, ſuppoſe the firſt degree of <hi>Aries</hi> through the Zodiack to the ſame point again, be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within this ſpace of time, <hi>viz.</hi> of 365 dayes, 5 hours, 49. minutes, and 4 ſeconds: and other odd ſcruples not worth naming in this Computation, According to <hi>Bullialdus,</hi> or, as <hi>Longomontanus,</hi> 365 d. 5 h. 48 min. 55 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, <hi>Long.</hi> l. 1. <hi>Theor.</hi> c. 5. p. 2227. and other eminent Aſtronomers; Then there will fall out 11 min.

year will tranſcend the true ſtate of the Sun's menſuration. For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every year 6 compleat hours to make a day for the Biſſextile-year being every fourth in order, which doth not preciſely agree with the Sun. For it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by 4 times 11 minutes, which every fourth year ariſes to 44′. Or to ſpeak more preciſely:<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Wherein the celebration of this Feſtivity ought to anticipate the 25 of <hi>December</hi> in our common <hi>Julian</hi> year, and ought to be celebrated almoſt 12 dayes before our ordinary time. As to which who is ſo ignorant as not to know that therefore the Pontificians do according to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Emendation precede us by 10 dayes, in their account which is called the New Style? But they went no higher than the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council in the correction of the year, and ſo fell ſhort in this point of the true time. The reaſon why they went no higher, I leave for them to give.</p>
                  <p>As for the celebration of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> it is not unknown to ſuch as are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately verſed in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, what ſtirs there have been in the Church in the 5th. 6th. and 7th.

Whereby it comes to paſſe, that this Feſtival does ſo vary every year according to that Sabhath which follows the full Moon next after the vernal-Equinoxe. Whereas ſeeing the deſign of the Chriſtians was therein to commemorate the time of our Lords Reſurrection: If they would have kept the exact time, they ſhould have conſidered what day of the year he aroſe, and what time of the morning of that day as near as may be to Scripture, and by the beſt Rules have found out the Sun's place exactly in the Zodiack, and when the Sun did Return unto that point in every year, to celebrate it accordingly.<note n="(a)" place="margin">

To ſignifie that by the clothing of Chriſts righteouſneſs, the great Sacrifice for ſin, our nakedneſs is hidden from the ſight of God. But why muſt the Prieſt in following times after the ſolemn introduction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rites of the Moſaical Law, have the skin of the Sacrifice? To ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that in the firſt place God would have the pains and labour of his ſervants in his worſhip to be alway rewarded. We learn alſo hereby, that every mans Offering is to have the outward skin of profeſſion pulled off, God looks to the heart and inwards of our duties, what fat and fleſh there is upon our ſervices. But the Prieſt he muſt have the skin: he is to take care of and look to the very externals of worſhip, that they be managed according to the preſcript forme of Gods will, and is to have recompence for ſuch his ſervice. 'Tis not the skin that will ſatisfie or pleaſe God in our Offerings: He that ſearches the heart, expects we ſhould worſhip him in ſpirit and truth.</p>

                     <p>The firſt thing obſervable at his initiation into this great work, was to waſh his fleſh in water, which poſſibly might prelude to the Baptiſm of our Lord,<note n="i" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16.</note> wherewith he was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> before he entred upon his Miniſterial ſervice, of teaching and ſuffering for his people. But (alas) it was not that thereby he himſelf ſhould be cleanſed, for he was the innocent Lamb of God that took away the ſins of the world: but rather that he might (as an Ancient ſpeaks) cleanſe the water by the deſcent of his bleſſed body into it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purify and conſecrate the Ordinance of Baptiſm for the benefit of his Church, which he intended to<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>The Ancient Prieſts carrying about them natures defiled with ſinne, needed continual waſhing: but our pure and ſpotleſſe Prieſt had nothing of impurity in him: yet, when being in the form of man, he ſubmits to this Ordinance, and<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15.</note> ſo fulfills all righteouſneſſe.</p>

                     <p>The firſt thing that the High-Priſt did after he was thus waſht and cloathed, and had ſlain the Bullock for the Sinne-Offering, was his entrance into the moſt holy place<note n="f" place="margin">

It is obſerved by ſome (too curiouſly I doubt) that our bleſſed Lord had ſeven wounds inflicted upon him, which drew blood from his bleſſed body. (1.) In his ſcourging; (2.) in the platting of the Crown of ſharp thornes upon his head; (3, 4.) the nailing of both his hands, (5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6) and both his feet, and (7) the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his body with the Spear.

                     <p>Mention is made of the end why the blood of the Bullock was brought into the moſt holy place, even to expiate for the ſins of the High-Prieſt himſelf; it was his Offering. Whereby was ſignified the inſufficiency and invalidity of the Jewiſh Prieſt-hood of it ſelf, to impetrate from God any pardon for ſin, ſeeing it ſelf did need and require an annuall atonement and reconciliation for its own ſins in the ſight of God. So that the High Prieſt was to be full of compaſſion to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2, 3.</note> that he himſelf alſo was compaſſed wth infirmity; and by reaſon thereof, ought as for the people, ſo alſo for himſelf, to offer for ſins. But ſuch an high Prieſt became us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27.</note> who needeth not daily (as thoſe did) to offer up Sacrifice firſt for his own ſins, and then for the peoples: For this he did once, when he offered up himſelf. Now although Chriſt had no ſin of his own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to expiate for himſelf, yet he did perſonally bear all the ſinnes of the Elect
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:110568:181"/>
upon him by divine imputation; and therefore he did imputatively offer up for himſelf, but effectively and virtually only for the Elect. And therefore, as the Apoſtle ſaies in the laſt cited place, he did it but once.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, as this blood was ſprinkled within the Veil to purify it from unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it ſignified and hinted to us the wonderfull defilement, and contagious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, that had pierced into the moſt holy place, thereby intimating that the higheſt and moſt eminent ſervices in our worſhip may be polluted with ſinne, and need purification by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, as the place within the Veil ſignified Heaven, ſo the bringing the blood of Chriſt thither, ſhews that Heaven is an<note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30.</note> the day of Redemption. For we are not fully redeemed from all our ſins and miſeries, till we ſet foot within the vail by virtue of the price of Chriſts bloud.<note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19.</note> Let us then lay hold upon the hope that is ſet before us, as an Anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, which entreth into that [moſt holy place] within the vail, whither the fore-runner even Jeſus is entred for us. We may therefore now have a holy and reverent<note n="d" place="margin">

                     <p>It is to be obſerved further, That the Highprieſt went into the Oracle with this bloud<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.17</note> alone, he had none with him. It was his peculiar Office, which none might preſume to perform beſides himſelf. So did Chriſt enter alone, to ſhew that there is no other Highprieſt or Head of his Church, but he alone. There is none of the Saints gone into Heaven with body and ſoul together, and continue there in ſo compleat a ſtate of happineſs poſſibly, as they ſhall be after the Day of Judgment. His glorified body only is in the moſt holy place, ſitting at the right hand of God. Here we might move a Queſtion about <hi>Enoch, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah, Lazarus,</hi> and the Saints that roſe at Chriſts death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall receive a further ſtate of perfection at the Reſurrection, ſeeing Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to be the firſt fruits of them that ſlept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 23. Further, as the Prieſt entred alone with the bloud for purification: So 'twas Chriſt that<note n="f" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3.</note> trod the winepreſs of his Fathers wrath <hi>alone,</hi> of the people there was none with him. It is recorded alſo that at his apprehenſion, his Diſciples<note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mark</hi> 14.50</note> all forſook him and fled.</p>
                     <p>After the Highprieſt had reconciled the moſt holy place, he was to go forth and<note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.18.</note> put of the bloud of the Ballock and Goat upon the horns of the golden Altar, and to ſprinkle ſeven times upon it, and do ſo likewiſe to the Tabernacle, by which I humbly conceive is meant the holy place or Sanctuary, at the upper end whereof neer the vail ſtood the golden Altar. What this golden Altar, and its horns ſignified, I have ſpoken before. The Incenſe noted Prayer. Hereby in the firſt place may be ſignified, that by virtue of Chriſts bloud it is, that his prayers and mediations for the Church are heard and accepted before the throne of God. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Interceſſion is built upon his paſſion, and for all that he ſuffered, them he prayes for. As to the prayers of the Saints, it is to be noted, that none are effectual but ſuch as proceed through Chriſts Cenſer, perfumed with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of his intermediation with the Father for us.</p>
                     <p>The bloud put upon it, noted, that the infirmities and ſinfulneſs of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are to be purged and taken away by the bloud of Chriſt: As he ſaid, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine laeva lachrymas,</hi> Lord waſh my tears; we muſt ſay, Waſh them in the bloud of Chriſt, and perfume our ſighs with his precious odours.</p>
                     <p>The four horns tipt with bloud ſignifies the prevalency and vigorous ſtrength of his prayers when he treats with his Father on our behalf upon the account of his precious bloud.</p>
                     <p>As the four horns did look to the four winds of Heaven, and the four quarters of the Earth, which (to allude) poſſibly might ſignifie the availableneſs of Chriſts
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:110568:182"/>
prayers for all believers throughout the world, who put their truſt in him, and lift up their prayers to Heaven in his bleſſed name.</p>
                     <p>The horns of this Altar might ſet forth the ſtrength of prayer, both for the good of the Church, and for the ruine of her enemies, and therefore is it that we read of odours ſmoaking at the golden Altar,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3.</note> and immediately upon the Saints prayers the ſeven Angels prepared their Trumpets to ſound warre, deſolation and ruine to the adverſaries of the Church, and at the ſounding of the ſixth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. There was a voice (or return of prayers) that came from the four Horns of the golden Altar,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.13.</note> which is before God.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, as the Tabernacle or Sanctuary was alſo to be purged with bloud; this might ſhew to us, that all our holy ſervices wherein we draw nigh to God, muſt be waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt: or elſe God will find matter enough therein to condemn us, unleſſe he take away the iniquity of our holy things, we ſhall never be able to ſtand in Gods ſight, or to anſwer him one of a thouſand for all the choiſeſt and higheſt performances which we yeeld to his Majeſty, with the moſt ardent and heavenly frames that our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can poſſibly be in, while we walk here below in Tabernacles of clay.</p>
                     <p>When the Prieſt had finiſhed this work of Atonement for the Oracle and Sanctuary, he then came out into the Court to the ſcape Goat, and performs the work before-recited.</p>
                     <p>You heard of two Goats, the one by lot was pitcht upon for a ſin-offering, whoſe bloud we ſee was carried into the moſt holy place.</p>

I rather ſuppoſe they might exhibit the two States of his Humanity, his Paſſion, and his Reſurrection. For, becauſe the ſame creature could not both ſuffer death, and preſently live again without a miracle. Therefore one was appointed to death, to repreſent our bleſſed Lord his ſuffering death upon the Croſs: The other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bloud of the former had been ſprinkled, was to eſcape, ſignifying his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; He was <hi>the ſlain Goat</hi>

                     <p>The ſcape Goat, although a poor creature in it ſelf, uncapable of ſinne, yet had all the ſinnes of the people confeſſed over its head: So Chriſt<note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.</note> who knew no ſinne, yet was made ſinne for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.

                     <p>Hitherto let it ſuffice to have ſpoken of Sin-Offerings, and eſpecially concerning the great and pompous day of expiation. The next that follows is the Treſpaſſe-Offering, of which I ſhall only ſay thus much, that as thereby there was an atonement and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made for more groſs and hainous ſins, the Law and manner about the Sin-Offering, and the Treſpaſſe-Offerng being all one in the main: we may obſerve, that the greateſt ſins, for which God is pleaſed to grant repentence, are pardonable through the blood of Chriſt. Only as under the Law, there was no Offering for ſins of preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: ſuch perſons muſt die themſelves, and their own blood muſt lie upon them. So under the Goſpel, preſuming ſinners are under a moſt dangerous ſtate, eſpecially if they preſume to ſin againſt the holy Spirit.<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>The Cauſes of the Peace-Offering are at large recited Chap. 5. of this Treatiſe. I ſhall only ſpiritualize ſome things about them and ſo conclude.</p>
                     <p>In this Sacrifice principally were the joyfull Feaſts exhibited. For uſually they were divided into three parts or Portions: the firſt part was Gods, who is the great Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and makes a<note n="c" place="margin">

                     <p>Beſides, the breaſt was his, and therefore <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaies, <hi>[Moneri ſacerdotes in pectore geſtare mundas cogitationes, legis notitiam &amp; dogmatum veritatem.]</hi> the Prieſt was thereby admoniſhed to bear in his breaſt pure thoughts, knowledge of the law and truth in his opinions. And laſtly, the maw, where he adds, [<hi>Venter luxuriam,</hi> &amp;c.] It denoted his abſtinence from luxury and all manner of excels. Theſe I only propoſe nakedly for them who pleaſe to receive or reject theſe ancient notions. If they held forth any thing, then theſe two, the breaſts and the ſhoulder, which were Wave-Offerings, given from the people to the Prieſt, might chiefly be inſiſted on. 1. He was to have the ſhoulder, becauſe of his bearing the people, and carrying them and their Sacrifices before God. 2. The breaſt, the ſeat of the heart, to note his compaſſion, tenderneſs, and bowels to them, bearing them alwaies in his Prayers and and ardent ſighs to the throne of Grace.</p>

Wherefore we make it not to have been Typical, but as a Moral Duty, grounded upon equity, and the Law of Nature in the main: that is, as maintenance: and the <hi>quota pars,</hi> or the tenth of mens ſubſtance upon a poſitive Law obſerved by the Patriarchs before the Law. Now ſuch things as were before the Ceremonial Law, and continued under the Law, though ſomtimes fortified by the Moral and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws, were alſo to remain after the abrogation of the ceremonies, and not to determine at that time: As for example, the ſeventh part of our time ſtands dedicated to God by a moral Inſtitution, being appointed before the Law was given in the Wilderneſs, even in the ſtate of Innocence, and therefore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues after the Law, even in the times of the Goſpel, although the ſeventh part part of the week be changed to another day, yet a ſeventh part ſtill continues; ſo likewiſe ſome acknowledgement of our ſubſtance and goods, the encreaſe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:110568:188"/>
of our grounds, and the fruit of our labours, is to be rendred up to God as a moral duty, as thereby owning him to be our God, and the giver of all our bleſſings. But now the <hi>quota pars,</hi> or how much of this is to be dedicated, ſtands in force by the poſitive Law of his Declarative Will; which I have ſhewn to be the tenth: God declaring that the tenth is his, 'tis his portion in the world, which he gives to his ſervants whom he appoints for the celebration of his worſhip. Wherefore even Heathens by the light of nature knowing that there is a God, and conſequently that this God is to be worſhipped, and then, that there muſt be adminiſtrators, or managers of this Worſhip, who becauſe of their conſtant attendance thereon, could not, nay might not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves in any worldly affairs, therefore ought to have ſome ſet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, whereby their lives might be preſerved, according to the dignity of their place: wherefore they generally aſſigned them the tenths; either dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it by tradition from the ancient Patriarchs after the flood, to whom they were allyed in collateral lines, or elſe by imitation of the Worſhip of God in <hi>Canaan.</hi> This I could abundantly teſtifie out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond branch of the objection is, That this way of maintenance is Popiſh and Antichriſtian, being brought into the Church after the defection from the Truth, and the riſe of the man of ſin.</p>
                  <p>As to this, the want of skill and knowledge in the hiſtory of the Church, may be indulged and pardoned: for no man is bound to ſpeak more then he knows; yet to aſſert it ſo vehemently, as ſome have done, that's unhandſom, and not befitting any ſober ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Let them then know, that after the ten perſecutions of the Primitive times were ended, and peace and reſt given to the churches of Chriſt by the great bleſſing of God under the glorious Reigne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, that godly Emperour, that he made a Decree and Law,<note place="margin">

                  <p>That it was many years before the clear manifeſtation of the Man of ſin, which was in the year 602, when the cruel <hi>Phocas</hi> conſtituted the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> head over all Biſhops, and then was he revealed with power: It is true,<note place="margin">Whitak.

                     </note> an Antichriſtian ſpirit catching after ſuperiority, and uſurping of the place of Chriſt, to be Head of the Church, did work even in the Apoſtles days; and yet no ſober perſon will ſay (I hope) that thoſe times were Popiſh. But to clear up all, The Nicene Council manifeſts the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to have ſhined with great luſter of truth, as appears by the Nicene Creed or Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compoſed by three hundred and thirteen Fathers then met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Council, which is commonly to be ſeen: for five of the three hundred and eighteen did diſagree from it, (<hi>Hotting. Eccleſ. Hiſt part.</hi> 1. p. 174.) They determined alſo clearly againſt <hi>Arius</hi> the Heretick, who oppoſed the Divinity of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In theſe times of the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel was it that the godly Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſtated a ſet rate for the Miniſtery. Afterwards here in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> the Saxon Kings having expelled the Britiſh out of their ancient Seats, being themſelves then Pagans, at laſt were converted to the Faith, and holding poſſeſſion of the Land by the Title of Conqueſt, of what Lands they kept to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:110568:189"/>
the Crown, and of what they enfeoffed their great Lords in, to hold under them, they retained nine parts, and made a donation, or deed of gift of the tenth part to the Clergie: ſo that there is no one perſon in the land that hath at preſent any injury, or is oppreſſed thereby. For if Landlords, they never purchaſed the tenth: If they be tenants, they never paid for any Hold or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the Tenths, either by Fine or Rent: The tenth part being always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon the account of the ancient Donation, as the Miniſters particular ſtated portion; unleſs what is alienate by Impropriation in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: ſo that all the great men of the Nation holding their lands either by Grant from the Crown, or Patrimonial deſcent, or purchaſe, do thereupon ſtill retain the right of Patronage, or preſentment to ſuch places, whereof their Anceſtors were poſſeſſed at the time of the Donation. So that this Tenure and poſſeſſion proceeds from the free gift of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who ſeeing a neceſſity of maintaining a godly, learned, and painful Miniſtry, thought it the higheſt prudence to fix upon ſome ſetled rate and portion annually to be aſſigned over to that uſe and behoof; who becauſe of the example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarchs before the Law, and the command and inſtitution of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, thought no courſe could be better taken, then to follow thoſe leading examples, and not to give either an eighth, or ninth, or a twelfth, or twentieth part of their eſtates, but a tenth, which hath ſince been confirmed by manifold Acts and Decrees of ſucceſſive Parliaments of this Nation, both before and ſince the Reformation. But as to the manner and way, I think no ſober and ſerious perſon will much heſitate, in caſe there be a fixed rate ſet and appointed; that ſo their condition may not fluctuate, and be ſubject to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; their hopes of ſupply being elſe fruſtrate under ſome neceſſities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, as to the third branch of the objection which lies againſt forced maintenance. There is no perſon in this point unjuſtly and unrighteouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and compelled, nor in the leaſt meaſure oppreſſed; When the godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the Nation do cauſe the Laws touching that ancient Free gift and Donation, granted by their Anceſtors, to be put in execution: for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque Tabulae,</hi> and doubtleſs may, as godly <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> did,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 31.4.</note> command the people that dwelt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to give the portion [of the Lord's Miniſters] that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord. So that there was not of late, even in the times of the Biſhops one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that which was called the Eaſter-offering that was paid of 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a piece out of the peoples purſes, which is now generally fallen with the late Hierarchy: Inſomuch that what people will give freely to ſuch with whom they are in Communion and Church-Fellowſhip, is wholly left to their Chriſtian love, and zeal to the Miniſtry and Ordinances. So that if men throughout the Nation generally were left to their own Free-wills, unleſs it be for ſuch whoſe hearts the Lord hath touched with ardent affections, and tender love to his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if the godly Civil Magiſtrate did not interpoſe for the conſervation of the Rights of Miniſters, the generality of the carnal, formal, and ungodly people, (who hate a ſound ſoul-ſearching, and convincing Miniſtry, and are by the conſcientious and faithful diſpenſers of the Word, by reaſon of their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſins, juſtly kept off from ruining their own ſouls in eating and drinking their own damnation, by receiving unworthily at the Lord's Table) they would be ſo far from contributing freely and liberally to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch a Sound, Holy, and Godly Miniſtry, as that they would generally deny to render thoſe very Dues, to which the people can never in any Juſtice lay the leaſt Claim to, as being by a Deed of Gift paſt over to the Miniſtry by our Zealous Fore-fathers, in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel, and ſince eſtabliſhed by ſo many ſtrong and binding Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:110568:189"/>But there are ſtill ſome perſons (who I charitably hope) would not foſter and cheriſh in their breaſts any obſtinacy and oppoſition againſt a faithful, holy, able and ſincere Miniſtrey) that yet do fly to the examples of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who that he might not be <hi>chargeable</hi> to the Churches,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9.</note> would rather work with his hands, and think it a fit preſident for Miniſters to uſe ſome calling whereby to get their livelihoods. To whom I would reply in the ſpirit of meekneſs and ſoberneſs: Firſt, That the Apoſtles needed not to ſtudy, they had the gift of Tongues and utterance, they had an extraordinary meaſure of the Spirit of God poured out upon them in the day of Pentecoſt;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4.</note> they had the gifts of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to conciliate and gain Authority to their Doctrine where ever they came, and the revelation of the myſterie of grace clearly manifeſted to them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now ſuch extraordinary gifts being ceaſed, Miniſters muſt give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine; they muſt meditate on theſe things,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 15.</note> and give themſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to them, that their profiting may appear to all, which work if they conſcionably perform, looking at the injunction of God, and the profit of ſouls, they will finde little time to ſpend in outward vocations and buſineſſes of the world, which take off the edge of the affections from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and put them out of a prepared frame for Goſpel ſervices, unleſs they were ſure to enjoy infallibly the preſence and anointing of the Holy Spirit in an extraordinary manner, unto the ſeveral emergencies of their duties. I doubt not, but godly Miniſters, if they had ſuch eminent and miraculous aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (which the primitive times enjoyed) for the performance of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent ſervices in the Goſpel, they would be content to betake themſelves to ſuch moderate imployments in Trade and Merchandize, as whereby poſſibly they might attain to ſome good eſtates, by the bleſſing of God, as well as others, they being generally no more deſtitute of parts then other men, if this were the minde of God, and the rule of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, The ſtate of the Churches in the Apoſtles times was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor and mean, and not able to contribute to their neceſſities. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth frequently complain of the poverty of the Saints, and acquaints us, that <hi>not many mighty, not many noble were called:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

But alas, it is to be feared, that there are many great ones, (whoſe caſe is ſadly to be bemoaned and lamented over) that ſpend far more annually in the maintaining of Faulconers and Huntſmen (to ſay no worſe) then they expend upon pious uſes: The Lord lay not their ſin unto their charge. How far are ſuch perſons from the temper of the primitive Saints in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days, who mutter and grumble at the preſent condition of the Miniſtrey, which at this day is generally ſo low and mean, that their very Miniſtrey is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt brought into contempt and reproach among the wicked and prophane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the vulgar. The ſtate of the Church of Chriſt before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> days, was generally under perſecution, and afflicted in moſt places with deep pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then indeed there was a neceſſitous duty lying upon the Miniſters to take
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:110568:190"/>
ſome care for their Families, or elſe they would prove worſe then Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
                  <p>Such perſons who inſiſt ſo warmly upon this point of Miniſters working ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of ſome of the Apoſtles (for it ſeems all did not; except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.</note> others did forbear working) I would wiſh them to look to their duty likewiſe, to follow the example of the Primitive Saints: (for the ſame rule in all equity bindes them on the other ſide) For,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34.</note> 
                     <hi>there was none among them that lacked: For as many as were poſſeſſours of lands or houſes, ſold them, and brought the prices of the things that were ſold, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet.</hi> I fear me, thoſe that are rich perſons, who preſs this labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters in worldly vocations ſo much, will come off very dolly and ſlowly to this work of ſelling all and laying it down at the Miniſters feet. I am ſure the poor would not complain ſo generally as they do, nor the Miniſtrey be driven from their duties to worldly labours (if this their abſurd inference ſhould take place) if ſuch would do their duty in this caſe, which is inferred upon their own ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, As to the times of the Apoſtles, we are to conſider likewiſe, that Chriſtian Religion had not then ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r prevailed, as to get any ſtrong foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Princes Courts: So that there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrates to be a hedge about the Church, and to take care in this particular for the comfortable ſupport of the Miniſtrey. The Apoſtles declared the will of God ſufficiently, but they had no coercive power in this point, and though doubtleſs, many might make conſcience, who were able to do it, yet there wanted not a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to forſake even them, and to embrace this preſent world: No doubt, there were ſeveral perſons, that being not ſoundly wrought upon, did pull back, and withdraw;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> as we read in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> elſe what needed the frequent and fervent exhortations to this duty of communicating. But when once Chriſtian Magiſtrates aroſe, they took care for a certain rate or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to be impoſed on the people for this purpoſe, as it was in the days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius:</hi> And why that which is incumbent as a duty upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, may not be made one of the Topicall or Municipal Laws in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom, State, or Commonwealth, I ſee no reaſon, ſince it tends to the preſervation of Gods publique Worſhip under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But however, in this caſe it is very dangerous for any perſons who have this worlds goods, to plead poverty, and going behinde hand, to palliate their want of love to the Miniſtrey, to excuſe them from this important work. Poſſibly the Lord may providentially blaſt ſuch mens eſtates ere they are aware: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whatever is detracted ſecretly from that uſe, will make bad portions for their poſterity.<note place="margin">

No certainly! But let ſuch conſider, that the very Heathens dealt more nobly and candidly with their Idolatrous Prieſts, who helpt on the poor creatures towards hell, Yet becauſe under the ſenſe of ſome Religions, though falſe worſhip, they were moſt of them very liberal. It is not my deſign to quote any Humane teſtimonies at preſent, I ſhall content my ſelf with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one example out of Scripture, which the Spirit of God takes notice of, and that is, of the people of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the days of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> although they were then exerciſed under a ſore judgement of Famine, when all the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land had ſold their goods and poſſeſſions to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for the Kings uſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen,</hi> 49.26.</note> yet the lands of the Prieſts were <hi>even then</hi> excepted.</p>
                  <p>I heartily wiſh, that ſuch poor ſouls as are tainted with diſaffection to the maintenance of the Goſpel Miniſtrey (that otherwiſe poſſibly ſome of them

               <p>Now then to apply the time of this ſad Cataſtrophe and diſſolution of the Temple, to the <hi>Julian</hi> period: For which purpoſe, we muſt at preſent aſſume ſome things (but yet ſuch are now generally agreed on, and demonſtrated by able Authors) 1. That the firſt year of the true time of our Lords Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was co-incident with 4710 year of that happily-invented <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and alſo with the 4000 year of the world. 2. That the firſt of <hi>Nabonaſſars</hi> Aera did correſpond with the 3967 year of the forementioned Period. To which if we adde 159 compleat years of <hi>Nabonaſſar's</hi> (for it was in the 160 current) the Sum brings us to the 4126 year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period; in which the 19 year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (deduced from his firſt beginning to reign, while his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was yet alive) doth compleatly fall, If further, we ſhall ſubſtract 4126 from 4710. the year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period at our Lords birth; the reſidue will be 584 years before Chriſts true birth-time, or 588 before the vulgar computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is four years behinde the truth, when the Temple was deſtroyed. Laſtly, If we deduce thoſe 584 years before Chriſt, from 4000 the year of the world wherein Chriſt was born, according to the beſt computations, the reſidue points out 3416. for the year of the world wherein the Temple was burnt, according to this calculation of the times.</p>

But when the ſecond time they attempted it, ſome fire violently iſſued out of the foundations, and [other] fire fell down impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly from Heaven, and conſumed more then before. <hi>There is</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>ſome variations among Authors of the punctual time and manner of this accident of fire, but the main of the truth is without doubt.</hi> Moreover, the fire which came down from Heaven conſumed to aſhes the hammers, graving tools, ſaws, hatchets, axes, and all the other inſtruments which the Workmen had brought for their ſervice, continuing a whole day together, &amp;c, when <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was at that time Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaw theſe things: He conſidered in his minde the word of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> to which Chriſt alſo had ſet his ſeal in the holy Goſpel: He told them all, that now was the time that the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Saviour had its accompliſhment; which ſaid, That a ſtone ſhould not remain upon a ſtone in the Temple. And when he had ſpoken this, a ſore earthquake aſſailed the foundations, and caſt out all the remaining ſtones, and diſperſed them. Upon this, there aroſe a fearful ſtorm, and whirled into the ayr many thouſand buſhels of lime and plaiſter, and ſudden flames of fire flaſhing from beneath, burnt up in a moment an innumerable company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that were as yet either labouring in the work, or that came to behold it. Thus did <hi>Julian</hi> fulfil Chriſts predictions concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have made void, &amp;c. Theſe prodigies are ſufficient to prove the truth of the Oracle: But what ſhall be now declared, being very wonderful, will further confirm it, which I ſhall report, as I have found in the Archives, and it is thus: When the foundations were a laying, as I have ſaid, there was a ſtone among the reſt, to which the bottom of the foundation was faſtned, that ſlipt from its place, and diſcovered the mouth of a cave which had been cut in the rock. Now when they could not ſee to the bottom by reaſon of its depth; the Overſeers of the building being deſirous to have certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the place, tied a long rope to one of the Labourers, and let him down: He being come to the bottom, found water in it, that took him up to the mid-ancles, and ſearching every part of that hollow place, he found it to be four ſquare, as far as he could conjecture by feeling. Then returning toward the mouth of it, he hit upon a certain little pillar, not much higher then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lighting with his hand upon it, found a book lying there wrapped up in a piece of thin and clean linnen. Having taken it into his hands, he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the rope that they ſhould draw him up. When he was pulled up, he ſhews the book, which ſtruck them with admiration, eſpecially ſeeming ſo freſh and untoucht as it did, being found in ſo dark and obſcure a hole. The Book being unfolded,<note place="margin">
